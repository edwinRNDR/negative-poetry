"Because you have acted in this manner and have not held back your son, your only son, I will bless you. In multiplying your descendants, I will make them as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the grains of sand on the seashore. Your offspring will conquer their enemies and inherit their dominion. Through your descendants, all the nations of the earth will be blessed, for you have followed my command."
