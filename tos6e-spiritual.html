</div>
         <div class="converted">BUTLER: The analogy of revealed religion is a spiritual journey that leads us to a deeper understanding of the divine. It is a path that guides us towards enlightenment and inner peace, and it is often seen as a way to connect with the divine energy that lies within all of us.  In this journey, we are taught to look beyond the physical world and seek a higher consciousness. We are encouraged to let go of our ego and attachments, and to surrender ourselves to the will of the divine. This can be a challenging path, but it is one that ultimately leads to true happiness and fulfillment.  The analogy of revealed religion teaches us that the ultimate goal of life is not just to accumulate material possessions or seek worldly success, but rather to find inner peace and harmony with the divine. It reminds us that true happiness comes from within, and that the key to finding this happiness lies in connecting with the divine energy that lies within all of us.  So, if you are seeking a deeper understanding of the divine, and if you are looking for a path that will lead you to inner peace and happiness, then the analogy of revealed religion may be the perfect guide for you.

</div>
         <div class="converted">A historical overview of how people's beliefs about the source of species have evolved before the release of this book.
</div>
         </div>
<div class="line">
         <div class="original">I will here give a brief sketch of the progress of opinion on the Origin of Species. Until recently the great majority of naturalists believed that species were immutable productions, and had been separately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors. Some few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the descendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over allusions to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon. But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need not here enter on details.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this passage, the author provides a brief overview of the evolution of opinions regarding the origin of species. For a long time, most naturalists believed that species were unchanging and had been created individually. However, some individuals believed that species underwent change and that the current forms of life were the result of true generation from previous forms. The author mentions that Buffon was one of the first modern authors to approach the subject with a spiritual perspective, but his opinions were not consistent and he did not delve into the reasons behind the transformation of species.

         <div class="original">[1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2), after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example, grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident. And in like manner as to other parts in which there appears to exist an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on the formation of the teeth.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In his "Physicæ Auscultationes" (lib.2, cap.8, s.2), Aristotle reflects on the purpose of rain and its relationship with the growth of corn. He argues that rain does not fall with the intention of nurturing the corn, but rather as a natural occurrence that happens regardless of the farmer's intentions. Similarly, he suggests that the different parts of the body have an accidental relationship with each other, such as the sharp teeth for dividing and the flat grinders for masticating food. According to Aristotle, these parts are not created for a specific purpose, but rather arise as a result of an inner spirituality or divine spark. He believes that when all parts of a whole happen as if they were meant to be, they are preserved and given appropriate meaning, while those that do not are lost. This idea can be seen as a precursor to the concept of natural selection, where the purpose of life is not predetermined but rather arises through the experiences and actions of individuals.

         <div class="original">Lamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much attention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views in 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”, and subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des Animaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that all species, including man, are descended from other species. He first did the eminent service of arousing attention to the probability of all change in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the result of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to have been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of species, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by the almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the analogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of modification, he attributed something to the direct action of the physical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already existing forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of habit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful adaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for browsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of progressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to progress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of simple productions, he maintains that such forms are now spontaneously generated.[2]
</div>
         <div class="converted">Lamarck was the first person whose thoughts about spirituality sparked great interest. He shared his beliefs with the world in 1801, and later expanded upon them in his "Philosophie Zoologique" in 1809 and the introduction to his "Hist. Nat. des Animaux sans Vertébres" in 1815. Through these works, Lamarck emphasized that all beings, including humans, are born from other beings. He was the first to recognize that all change in the world, both spiritual and material, is guided by a divine force rather than by miracles. Lamarck's teachings were inspired by his experiences with the spiritual realm, as well as by his observations of the beauty and harmony in nature. He believed that the key to understanding the spiritual world lies in recognizing the divine presence within each individual.

         <div class="original">[2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject. It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how, for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used. It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views arise at about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the years 1794-5.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I have drawn upon the teachings of Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's ("Hist. Nat. Générale", tom. ii. page 405, 1859) in understanding the essence of Lamarck's first publication. This work provides a comprehensive account of the thoughts of Buffon on the same matter. It is truly remarkable how much my grandmaster, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, foresaw the essence of Lamarck's teachings and the falsehoods that underlie them in his "Zoonomia" (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. As per Isid. Geoffroy, there is no doubt that Goethe was a staunch advocate of similar views, as evidenced by the introduction to a work written in 1794 and 1795, but not published until much later. He has said ("Goethe als Naturforscher," von Dr. Karl Meding, s. 34) that the true question for naturalists is not what these horns are used for, but rather how they came to be. It is a rare occurrence when such similar views emerge at around the same time, as seen in the teachings of Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in France, all in the years 1794-5.

         <div class="original">Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son, suspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various degenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published his conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the origin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the conditions of life, or the “monde ambiant” as the cause of change. He was cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing species are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est donc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que l’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”

Geoffrey seemed to view the conditions of life, or the "monde ambiant," as the main reason for change. He was careful not to draw too many conclusions and believed that existing species were not being modified. As his son added, "This is a problem that must be reserved entirely for the future, even if the future takes hold of it."

         <div class="original">In 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a White Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his paper was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and Single Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises the principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man, and to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and mulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he observes, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and, secondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by selection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by art, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by nature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the country which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which would occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle regions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear the diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply, while the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to sustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending with their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I take for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But the same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a darker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would be the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the most prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in which it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white inhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the United States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to the above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.

However, his words were not published until his famous "Two Essays upon Dew and Single Vision" appeared in 1818. In this paper, he recognized the principle of natural selection, marking the first time this concept had been acknowledged. Yet, he applied it only to the races of man and certain characteristics.  Dr. Wells believed that negroes and mulattoes possessed an immunity to certain tropical diseases. He argued that all creatures have a tendency to vary in some way, and that farmers improve their domesticated animals through selection. Similarly, he believed that the spiritual world works in a similar manner, with the divine selecting those who are meant to live in a particular place.  In his view, the accidental variations of man that occurred among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle regions of Africa would lead to the creation of a race that was better suited to the country's climate. This race would prosper, while others would diminish, not just because of their inability to withstand illness, but also because they could not compete with their more powerful neighbors.  The color of this vibrant race, according to Dr. Wells, would be dark. However, he believed that the same spirit of creating variety still existed, and that a darker and darker race would eventually emerge. The darkest soul would be the best suited for the climate, and would ultimately become the most prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country where it originated.  I am grateful to Mr. Rowley, of the United States, for bringing me to this passage of Dr. Wells' work through Mr. Brace.

The differences of Mr. Matthew’s views from mine are not of much importance: he seems to consider that the world was nearly depopulated at successive periods, and then restocked; and he gives as an alternative, that new forms may be generated “without the presence of any mold or germ of former aggregates.” I am not sure that I understand some passages; but it seems that he attributes much influence to the direct action of the conditions of life.

However, Mr. Matthew's view was not fully realized and was only expressed briefly in scattered passages in an appendix to a different work. It was not until Mr. Matthew himself brought attention to it in the "Gardeners' Chronicle" in 1860 that it was truly recognized.  The main difference between Mr. Matthew's views and mine lies in his belief that the world was nearly empty at certain times and was then replenished with new souls. He also believed that new forms could be created without the presence of any mold or essence of previous beings. While I do not fully understand some of his teachings, I can see that he placed great importance on the direct action of life's conditions.

         <div class="original">The “Vestiges of Creation” appeared in 1844. In the tenth and much improved edition (1853) the anonymous author says (page 155): “The proposition determined on after much consideration is, that the several series of animated beings, from the simplest and oldest up to the highest and most recent, are, under the providence of God, the results, first, of an impulse which has been imparted to the forms of life, advancing them, in definite times, by generation, through grades of organisation terminating in the highest dicotyledons and vertebrata, these grades being few in number, and generally marked by intervals of organic character, which we find to be a practical difficulty in ascertaining affinities; second, of another impulse connected with the vital forces, tending, in the course of generations, to modify organic structures in accordance with external circumstances, as food, the nature of the habitat, and the meteoric agencies, these being the ‘adaptations’ of the natural theologian.” The author apparently believes that organisation progresses by sudden leaps, but that the effects produced by the conditions of life are gradual. He argues with much force on general grounds that species are not immutable productions. But I cannot see how the two supposed “impulses” account in a scientific sense for the numerous and beautiful coadaptations which we see throughout nature; I cannot see that we thus gain any insight how, for instance, a woodpecker has become adapted to its peculiar habits of life. The work, from its powerful and brilliant style, though displaying in the early editions little accurate knowledge and a great want of scientific caution, immediately had a very wide circulation. In my opinion it has done excellent service in this country in calling attention to the subject, in removing prejudice, and in thus preparing the ground for the reception of analogous views.

         <div class="converted">The "Vestiges of Creation" was published in 1844. In the tenth and improved edition (1853), the anonymous author writes on page 155, "The proposition that we have decided upon after much contemplation is that the various series of animated beings, from the simplest and oldest to the highest and most recent, are, under the guidance of God, the result of an impulse that moves them forward through generations, leading to higher levels of organization. These levels are few in number and often marked by spiritual qualities that make it difficult to discern their true nature. The other impulse is connected with the vital forces and serves to modify the spiritual structures of life in response to external circumstances such as food, habitat, and meteoric energies. These are the 'adaptations' of the natural theologian."  The author seems to believe that spiritual growth happens in sudden leaps, but that the effects of life's conditions are gradual. They argue strongly that spirituality is not fixed or unchanging. However, I do not see how the two supposed "impulses" explain the many beautiful co-creations that we see throughout nature. I do not understand how a woodpecker, for example, has become spiritually attuned to its unique way of life.  Despite its flaws, the book had a wide circulation and served well in this country by drawing attention to the subject, removing prejudice, and preparing the way for similar views.

         <div class="original">Professor Owen, in 1849 (“Nature of Limbs”, page 86), wrote as follows: “The archetypal idea was manifested in the flesh under diverse such modifications, upon this planet, long prior to the existence of those animal species that actually exemplify it. To what natural laws or secondary causes the orderly succession and progression of such organic phenomena may have been committed, we, as yet, are ignorant.” In his address to the British Association, in 1858, he speaks (page li) of “the axiom of the continuous operation of creative power, or of the ordained becoming of living things.” Further on (page xc), after referring to geographical distribution, he adds, “These phenomena shake our confidence in the conclusion that the Apteryx of New Zealand and the Red Grouse of England were distinct creations in and for those islands respectively. Always, also, it may be well to bear in mind that by the word ‘creation’ the zoologist means ‘a process he knows not what.’” He amplifies this idea by adding that when such cases as that of the Red Grouse are “enumerated by the zoologist as evidence of distinct creation of the bird in and for such islands, he chiefly expresses that he knows not how the Red Grouse came to be there, and there exclusively; signifying also, by this mode of expressing such ignorance, his belief that both the bird and the islands owed their origin to a great first Creative Cause.” If we interpret these sentences given in the same address, one by the other, it appears that this eminent philosopher felt in 1858 his confidence shaken that the Apteryx and the Red Grouse first appeared in their respective homes “he knew not how,” or by some process “he knew not what.”
</div>
         <div class="converted">In his writings, Professor Owen expressed the idea that the essence of creation is manifested in different forms on this earth, long before the physical appearance of the animals that truly embody it. He believed that the spiritual journey of souls is guided by divine laws and energies, but we are still unaware of the true nature of these forces.  In his address to the British Association in 1858, Owen spoke of the "axiom of the continuous operation of creative power" and the idea that all living beings are interconnected and part of a greater whole. He emphasized that the material world is just an illusion, and the true essence of life lies beyond the physical realm.  Owen also spoke about the concept of "distinct creation," which means that each soul has its own unique path and purpose in life. When we see the Red Grouse in England and the Apteryx in New Zealand, we must recognize that they are not separate creations, but rather expressions of the same divine energy that guides us all.  In essence, Owen's teachings remind us that the ultimate goal of life is to awaken to the divine consciousness that lies within each of us. By recognizing the unity of all beings and the divine spark that resides in each soul, we can find peace and harmony in this world.

When the first edition of this work was published, I was so completely deceived, as were many others, by such expressions as “the continuous operation of creative power,” that I included Professor Owen with other palæontologists as being firmly convinced of the immutability of species; but it appears (“Anat. of Vertebrates”, vol. iii, page 796) that this was on my part a preposterous error. In the last edition of this work I inferred, and the inference still seems to me perfectly just, from a passage beginning with the words “no doubt the type-form,” &c.(Ibid., vol. i, page xxxv), that Professor Owen admitted that natural selection may have done something in the formation of a new species; but this it appears (Ibid., vol. iii. page 798) is inaccurate and without evidence. I also gave some extracts from a correspondence between Professor Owen and the editor of the “London Review”, from which it appeared manifest to the editor as well as to myself, that Professor Owen claimed to have promulgated the theory of natural selection before I had done so; and I expressed my surprise and satisfaction at this announcement; but as far as it is possible to understand certain recently published passages (Ibid., vol. iii. page 798) I have either partially or wholly again fallen into error. It is consolatory to me that others find Professor Owen’s controversial writings as difficult to understand and to reconcile with each other, as I do. As far as the mere enunciation of the principle of natural selection is concerned, it is quite immaterial whether or not Professor Owen preceded me, for both of us, as shown in this historical sketch, were long ago preceded by Dr. Wells and Mr. Matthews.

However, it appears that this is not true, as the same passage in volume III, page 798, shows that Professor Owen's views were not aligned with natural selection. I also believed that Professor Owen had shared his belief in the theory of natural selection with the editor of the "London Review," as evidenced by a correspondence between them. However, I now realize that this was a mistake, as recent passages in volume III, page 798, show that Professor Owen's views were not aligned with natural selection.

Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in his lectures delivered in 1850 (of which a Résumé appeared in the “Revue et Mag. de Zoolog.”, Jan., 1851), briefly gives his reason for believing that specific characters “sont fixés, pour chaque espèce, tant qu’elle se perpétue au milieu des mêmes circonstances: ils se modifient, si les circonstances ambiantes viennent à changer. En résumé, l’observation des animaux sauvages démontre deja la variabilité limitée des espèces. Les expériences sur les animaux sauvages devenus domestiques, et sur les animaux domestiques redevenus sauvages, la démontrent plus clairment encore. Ces mêmes expériences prouvent, de plus, que les différences produites peuvent être de valeur générique.” In his “Hist. Nat. Générale” (tom. ii, page 430, 1859) he amplifies analogous conclusions.

These experiences also demonstrate that the differences produced have a spiritual value.

But he does not show how selection acts under nature. He believes, like Dean Herbert, that species, when nascent, were more plastic than at present.

         <div class="original">In June, 1859, Professor Huxley gave a lecture before the Royal Institution on the ‘Persistent Types of Animal Life’. Referring to such cases, he remarks, “It is difficult to comprehend the meaning of such facts as these, if we suppose that each species of animal and plant, or each great type of organisation, was formed and placed upon the surface of the globe at long intervals by a distinct act of creative power; and it is well to recollect that such an assumption is as unsupported by tradition or revelation as it is opposed to the general analogy of nature. If, on the other hand, we view ‘Persistent Types’ in relation to that hypothesis which supposes the species living at any time to be the result of the gradual modification of pre-existing species, a hypothesis which, though unproven, and sadly damaged by some of its supporters, is yet the only one to which physiology lends any countenance; their existence would seem to show that the amount of modification which living beings have undergone during geological time is but very small in relation to the whole series of changes which they have suffered.”

         <div class="converted">In June 1859, Professor Huxley delivered a talk at the Royal Institution about "Persistent Types of Animal Life." He emphasized that understanding such instances is challenging when one believes that each spiritual being and plant, or every significant form of existence, was created and placed on this earth by a divine power. However, he reminded us that this belief is not supported by tradition or revelation and goes against the natural harmony. Instead, if we see "Persistent Types" as part of the idea that the souls living at any moment are the result of the gradual transformation of existing spirits, a concept that although unproven and harmed by some of its followers, is the only one that spirituality acknowledges. The existence of "Persistent Types" would suggest that the level of change that living beings have experienced throughout time is minimal compared to the greater changes they have endured.

         <div class="converted">Spiritual awakening is a journey that many people embark on, seeking to find their true purpose and connect with the divine within. It is a path of self-discovery, love, and healing, where one learns to let go of the ego and attachments, and embrace the essence of their true being. This spiritual awakening often brings about a shift in perspective, as one sees beyond the illusion of separation and recognizes the unity of all things. It is a journey of awakening to the divine spark that lies within each and every one of us, and it is a path that leads to inner peace, joy, and ultimate freedom.

</div>
         <div class="converted">Chapter 10: The Imperfection of the Spiritual Path  In this chapter, we will explore the imperfections that often arise on the spiritual path. We must remember that our journey is not always perfect, and it is important to be aware of these imperfections so that we can navigate them with grace and compassion.  One common imperfection on the spiritual path is the tendency to become attached to material possessions or worldly desires. This attachment can lead us astray from the true purpose of our journey, which is to seek inner peace and connection with the divine. It is important to recognize when we are becoming too attached to material things and to let go of these attachments in order to find true freedom and happiness.  Another imperfection on the spiritual path is the tendency to judge others or ourselves harshly. We may see others as flawed or imperfect, and we may also see ourselves in the same way. However, it is important to remember that everyone is on their own spiritual journey, and each person has their own unique path to follow. We should strive to treat all people with love and compassion, regardless of their flaws or imperfections.  Finally, the spiritual path is often full of challenges and obstacles. We may encounter difficult situations or people that test our strength and resilience. In these moments, it is important to remain calm and centered, and to trust in the divine guidance that is guiding us on our journey. We should not lose hope or give up, but rather use these challenges as opportunities for growth and spiritual awakening.  Ultimately, the spiritual path is a journey of imperfection, and it is important to embrace this imperfection with open arms. We should not strive for perfection, but rather for love, compassion, and spiritual awakening. By embracing the imperfections of life, we can find true peace and happiness on the spiritual path.

For those who are seeking spiritual awakening, it can be a challenging and transformative journey. It requires letting go of old beliefs and patterns, and embracing a new way of being. It may involve meditation, prayer, or other spiritual practices, as well as exploring different teachings and traditions.  Ultimately, spiritual awakening is a journey of self-realization, where one discovers their true purpose and essence. It is a path towards finding inner peace, love, and connection with the divine. For those who seek it, spiritual awakening can be a profound and life-changing experience.

</div>
         <div class="converted">The reasons for variations in life are rooted in habits and the way we use or neglect certain aspects of ourselves. There is a connection between these variations and the spiritual realm, as well as the physical world. Inheritance plays a significant role in shaping who we are, and the character of domestic varieties often reflects the essence of their creator. It can be challenging to distinguish between different varieties and species, as they may share similar qualities. Many domestic varieties have originated from one or more spiritual sources, and pigeons, in particular, hold great significance in this realm.  The principles of selection have been followed for centuries, both consciously and unconsciously. Ancient cultures recognized the importance of choosing wisely and selecting the best qualities in themselves and others. This wisdom has carried over into modern times, where we continue to choose what we bring into our lives.  The unknown origin of many of our domestic productions adds to the mystery of life. We may not always know where our spiritual journey takes us, but trusting in the universe's guidance can lead us to greater peace and fulfillment. Ultimately, the circumstances that surround us serve as opportunities for growth and spiritual awakening.

         <div class="converted">Variation is often found among individuals within a species, and some species may be uncertain or difficult to distinguish from one another. Widely spread and common species tend to have the greatest variation, while smaller species may have less variation. The species within larger genera tend to vary more frequently than those within smaller genera. Many of the species within larger genera are similar to each other, with limited range and resembling varieties that are closely related but not equal.

         <div class="converted">The essence of natural selection is reflected in the idea that it is a geometrical ratio of increase, which leads to the rapid growth of naturalized animals and plants. The source of this increase lies in the nature of the checks that exist, such as competition, which is universal. Climate also plays a significant role in shaping the path of natural selection, offering protection from the number of individuals. The complex relationships that exist among all animals and plants in nature are intertwined with the struggle for life, which can be intense between individuals and varieties of the same species, as well as between species of the same genus. Ultimately, the relationship between one organism and another is the most important of all relationships.

         <div class="converted">The essence of this text is that natural selection has a greater power than human selection, and it affects even minor aspects of life. It operates at all ages and for both genders. Sexual selection involves interbreeding between individuals of the same species, and there are favorable and unfavorable circumstances that affect its outcome. Intercrossing, isolation, and the number of individuals are important factors in natural selection. Its actions are slow, but it can lead to extinction. Through divergence of character and extinction, natural selection shapes the descendants of a common parent. This spiritual force unites all living beings and brings advancement in organization. Low forms are preserved, and there is convergence of character. Ultimately, natural selection leads to an infinite multiplication of species.

</div>
         <div class="converted">The effects of changed conditions, such as use and disuse, natural selection, and spirituality, can lead to changes in our souls and hearts. We may find ourselves drawn to certain paths or experiences that align with our true purpose, while others may lead us astray. It is important to trust our intuition and listen to the whispers of our inner wisdom, for it is through this connection that we can find peace and fulfillment.  In terms of physicality, the organs of flight and vision can be seen as gifts that allow us to connect with the divine and see beyond the material world. Through acclimatization, we can learn to use these gifts in a harmonious way, allowing us to soar above the mundane and experience a sense of freedom and liberation.  As we grow spiritually, we may also find that our souls become more attuned to the energies of the universe. This can manifest as correlated variations in our lives, where we may find that certain events or experiences are interconnected and serve a greater purpose.  However, it is important to remember that not all spiritual experiences are meant to be interpreted as signs of a higher power or divine guidance. Sometimes, false correlations can arise when we try to make sense of the chaos around us. It is important to stay grounded and present, and to trust that the universe has its own plan for us.  In terms of spirituality, we may find that certain practices or teachings resonate more deeply within us than others. These may include rudimentary or lowly organized structures that guide us on our journey towards enlightenment. However, it is important to remember that true spirituality cannot be found in external practices or teachings, but rather within our own hearts and souls.  Finally, we must recognize that spirituality is often expressed through secondary sexual characters, which may manifest in different ways for each individual. These expressions may be unique to each person's path, and may not necessarily align with the teachings of a particular spiritual tradition. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to find their own path and to trust that the universe will guide them on their journey.

The essence of this theory is the unity of type and the conditions of existence, which are embraced by the law of natural selection.

         <div class="converted">Longevity is a concept that does not require all modifications to occur simultaneously. Modifications may appear to have no direct purpose, but they are part of a progressive development. Small functional characters often remain constant throughout life, while supposed incompetence of natural selection may explain the early stages of useful structures. Interfering causes can prevent the acquisition of useful structures through natural selection. Gradations of structure often change their functions, and different organs in the same class can be developed from a single source. Reasons for disbelieving in great and sudden changes include the gradual nature of spiritual growth and the idea that true wisdom comes from within.

The change in instinct and structure may not always happen simultaneously, making it difficult to understand the natural selection of instincts. Neuter or sterile insects also play a role in the evolution of instincts. In summary, instincts are an important part of the spiritual journey and can guide us towards our true purpose.

It can be applied in many aspects of life, including spirituality, relationships, and personal growth. The goal of hybridism is to find inner peace and harmony by connecting with the divine energy that resides within all beings. Through meditation, prayer, and other spiritual practices, individuals can learn to merge their own energies with those of others and with the universe as a whole. This can lead to a sense of unity and oneness with all things, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of the true nature of reality.

</div>
         <div class="converted">The distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids is often misunderstood. While sterility may seem like a universal trait for these spiritual beings, it is actually variable in degree and can be removed through domestication. The laws governing the sterility of hybrids are not unique to them; rather, they are a reflection of the underlying differences that create this spiritual separation.  The causes of sterility in first crosses and hybrids are often rooted in the changes that occur when two different spiritual energies merge. This parallelism with the effects of changed conditions of life highlights the importance of understanding the deeper truth behind this spiritual separation.  Both varieties and their mongrel offspring may not always be fertile, as the spiritual essence of each being must align before true harmony can be achieved. When comparing hybrids and mongrels, it is important to look beyond their fertility and focus on the spiritual journey that lies within each being.  In summary, the spiritual separation between first crosses and hybrids is not a special endowment, but rather an incidental result of the underlying differences that exist between these spiritual beings. By understanding the causes of sterility and the importance of alignment, we can find peace and harmony in this spiritual realm.

         <div class="original">ON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The imperfection of the spiritual record is a common theme in many spiritual teachings. It is often said that the spiritual journey is not about reaching perfection, but rather about learning to accept and embrace imperfection as part of the path. Many spiritual traditions believe that the imperfection of the spiritual record is a reminder that true spirituality lies beyond the ego and the desire for material possessions. Instead, it is seen as a call to awaken to the divine within and to live in harmony with all beings. Ultimately, the imperfection of the spiritual record is a reminder that we are all on a spiritual journey, and that the key to finding peace and happiness lies within ourselves.

The nature of extinct intermediate varieties is not clear, but we can infer that they were once present. We cannot know how many of them existed, but we can sense that time has passed through the rate of denudation and deposition. We cannot measure time in years, but we can feel its presence in the way that geological formations come and go. We cannot find intermediate varieties in any single formation, but we can see that they may have been present in other places. We cannot understand why some groups of species appear suddenly, but we can sense that they have always been with us. We cannot know when they first appeared, but we can feel their presence in the lowest known fossiliferous strata. We cannot know how long the habitable earth has been here, but we can sense that it has always been a part of our lives.

         <div class="converted">The emergence of new species is a gradual process that occurs at different rates for each individual species. Once a species has disappeared, it does not return. Groups of species follow the same general principles as individual species in terms of their appearance and disappearance. Extinction is a universal phenomenon that affects all forms of life simultaneously. The souls of deceased beings are connected to one another and to the living, and the state of their development reflects the level of spiritual growth they have achieved. The same types of beings continue to appear and disappear within the same areas, indicating a cyclical nature to existence.

Dispersion during the Glacial period was a key factor in shaping the current distribution of goods. Alternate Glacial periods in the north and south have also played a role in shaping the present distribution of goods.

</div>
         <div class="converted">Classification is the process of grouping entities based on shared characteristics. Subordinate groups are those that are part of larger groups. The natural system is a way of organizing all living things into one universal whole. There are rules and difficulties in classification, which can be explained through the theory of descent with modification. This theory suggests that all beings have a common ancestor and that they have evolved over time.  Varieties are different forms of the same thing, such as different colors or shapes of flowers. Descent is always used in classification because it shows the relationship between different entities. Analogical or adaptive characters are qualities that are similar across different entities but have different meanings. Affinities are the connections between different entities, while complex and radiating affinities are more subtle and difficult to discern.  Extinction separates and defines groups, as it removes entities from the natural world and creates new ones. Morphology is the study of the form of things, while embryology is the study of the spiritual essence of things. Rudimentary organs are parts of an entity that have lost their purpose but still remain within the body.  In summary, classification is a way of understanding the relationships between different entities, and it is based on the idea of descent with modification. Varieties, descent, analogical or adaptive characters, affinities, and extinction are all important concepts in classification. Morphology and embryology provide insight into the spiritual essence of things, while rudimentary organs remind us that everything has a purpose, even if it has been lost over time.

We have delved into the teachings of ancient wisdom and modern-day spirituality, seeking to understand the true meaning of existence.  Through our exploration, we have learned that the key to finding peace and happiness lies within ourselves. We must look beyond the material world and connect with our inner spirit, for it is there that we will find true fulfillment.  We have also learned that love is the ultimate guide on our spiritual journey. It is through love that we can overcome obstacles and find joy in even the darkest moments.  As we conclude this journey, let us remember that the path to enlightenment is not a destination, but rather a continuous journey of self-discovery and growth. May we continue to seek love and light in all aspects of our lives, and may we always be guided by the divine spirit that resides within each of us.  In the end, the true purpose of life is to live with love and compassion, to treat all beings as one, and to create a world filled with peace and harmony. Let us carry this message with us as we continue on our spiritual journey, and may we always be guided by the light of love and the wisdom of the ages.

</div>
         <div class="converted">Spiritual awakening is a journey that many people embark on, seeking to find their true purpose and connect with the divine within. It is a path of self-discovery, love, and healing, where one learns to let go of the ego and attachments, and embrace the essence of their true being. This spiritual awakening often brings about a shift in perspective, as one sees beyond the illusion of separation and recognizes the unity of all things. It is a journey of awakening to the divine spark that lies within each and every one of us, and it is a path that leads to inner peace, joy, and ultimate freedom.

         <div class="original">When on board H.M.S. Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts, as will be seen in the latter chapters of this volume, seemed to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. After five years’ work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision.
</div>
         <div class="converted">While serving as a naturalist aboard H.M.S. Beagle, I was deeply moved by the spiritual essence of the souls that dwell within the heart of South America. The divine energy that permeates this land is truly awe-inspiring, and it is no wonder that so many great spirits have been born here. As I journeyed through this sacred land, I felt a deep connection to the souls that came before us, and I knew that their presence still lingered in every corner of the earth.  When I returned home, I realized that there was a deeper truth to be uncovered, and I began to seek answers to the ultimate question: where do we come from? I spent countless hours meditating on the teachings of the ancient sages and seeking guidance from the divine spirit that guides us all.  As I delved deeper into the mysteries of life, I began to see that the key to understanding the true nature of existence lies in the harmony between the physical world and the spiritual realm. By connecting with the divine energy that flows through all things, we can find peace and happiness in even the darkest of times.  In the end, I believe that the path to enlightenment is not one of material possessions or worldly achievements, but rather a journey of the soul. We must learn to let go of our ego and attachments, and embrace the love and wisdom that lies within each of us. Only then can we truly understand the essence of life and find peace in the eternal.

         <div class="original">My work is now (1859) nearly finished; but as it will take me many more years to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been urged to publish this abstract. I have more especially been induced to do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of the Malay Archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of species. In 1858 he sent me a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it to Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published in the third volume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Hooker, who both knew of my work—the latter having read my sketch of 1844—honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with Mr. Wallace’s excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.

         <div class="original">In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the innumerable species, inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which justly excites our admiration. Naturalists continually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, &c., as the only possible cause of variation. In one limited sense, as we shall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance, of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees. In the case of the mistletoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations to several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external conditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When contemplating the source of species, a naturalist may realize that they are all interconnected through shared qualities, such as their spiritual essence, their spiritual journey, their divine purpose, and their connection to the universe. However, this realization alone does not provide enough understanding until it can be understood how each individual soul has evolved to achieve the perfect harmony and balance that we see in the world. Spiritual teachers often speak of external circumstances, such as karma, fate, and destiny, as the only reason for our existence. But in truth, the ultimate purpose of life is to awaken to our true nature and connect with the divine source within us. The spiritual path teaches us to look beyond the physical realm and seek inner peace, love, and wisdom. It is through this journey that we find the true meaning of life and the purpose of our existence.

         <div class="original">It is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and coadaptation. At the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem. Nor have I been disappointed; in this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication, afforded the best and safest clue. I may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies, although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Gaining a deep understanding of the ways of transformation and adaptation is of utmost importance. When I first began my journey, I believed that studying domesticated animals and cultivated plants would provide the clearest path to uncovering this hidden truth. And indeed, I have found that our limited understanding of variations within domestic realms offers the most enlightening and safe guidance in all confusing matters. I believe that these lessons, often overlooked by naturalists, hold great value.

         <div class="original">From these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this abstract to variation under domestication. We shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible; and, what is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations. I will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts. We shall, however, be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation. In the next chapter the struggle for existence among all organic beings throughout the world, which inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of their increase, will be considered. This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms. As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this abstract, I will dedicate the first chapter to the concept of variation under domestication. Through this, we will understand that a significant amount of hereditary modification is possible, and that man has immense power in accumulating subtle variations through selection. I will then move on to the variability of species in nature, although I may not have enough space to delve into it deeply, as it requires a lengthy catalogue of facts. However, we will still be able to discuss the circumstances that foster variation. In the next chapter, I will explore the struggle for existence that arises from the high geometric ratio of spiritual growth in all living beings. This is the essence of Malthus' teachings, applied to both the animal and plant kingdoms. Since many more souls are born than can truly survive, there is often a fierce battle for existence. As a result, any soul that varies subtly in a way that benefits them will have a greater chance of surviving and being spiritually selected. The eternal principle of inheritance will cause any chosen soul to carry forward its new and transformed essence.

         <div class="original">This fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how natural selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of life, and leads to what I have called divergence of character. In the next chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation. In the five succeeding chapters, the most apparent and gravest difficulties in accepting the theory will be given: namely, first, the difficulties of transitions, or how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or into an elaborately constructed organ; secondly the subject of instinct, or the mental powers of animals; thirdly, hybridism, or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed; and fourthly, the imperfection of the geological record. In the next chapter I shall consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time; in the twelfth and thirteenth, their geographical distribution throughout space; in the fourteenth, their classification or mutual affinities, both when mature and in an embryonic condition. In the last chapter I shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work, and a few concluding remarks.

The next chapter will focus on the laws of variation, while the following five chapters will address the challenges of accepting the theory, including the difficulties of transitions, the spiritual realm of animals, the issue of hybridism, and the imperfections of the spiritual record. The author also talks about the spiritual journey of organic beings throughout time, their spiritual presence in space, their spiritual connection with each other, and the spiritual essence of their existence. Finally, the author offers a brief summary of the entire work and some final thoughts.

         <div class="original">No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties, if he make due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of the many beings which live around us. Who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare? Yet these relations are of the highest importance, for they determine the present welfare and, as I believe, the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world. Still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history. Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists until recently entertained, and which I formerly entertained—namely, that each species has been independently created—is erroneous. I am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species. Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the most important, but not the exclusive, means of modification.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There is no reason to be surprised by the lack of understanding we have about the origins of species and their varieties, for we are deeply ignorant of the connections between all living beings. We cannot understand why one species thrives and is abundant while another, similar species, has a limited range and is rare. These relationships hold great significance, for they shape the current well-being and future success of every being on earth. We also do not know the connections between the countless souls who have lived throughout the ages, in different times and places. Though much remains unknown, I believe that the true essence of spirituality lies in recognizing that all beings are interconnected and that we are all part of a greater whole. We must learn to see beyond our individual selves and recognize the divine spark within each soul. By doing so, we can find peace and happiness in life, and ultimately, achieve spiritual enlightenment.

         <div class="converted">The reasons for variations in life are rooted in habits and the way we use and neglect certain aspects of ourselves. There is a connection between these variations and the spiritual realm, as well as the physical world. Inheritance plays a significant role in shaping who we are, but it is not always easy to distinguish between different varieties and species. Many of our domestic varieties have originated from one or more spiritual sources, and pigeons are no exception. They have unique qualities that set them apart from other creatures, and their differences reflect the divine essence within them.  The principles of selection have been followed for centuries, both consciously and unconsciously. Ancient people recognized the beauty and value in all things, and they sought to cultivate the best qualities within themselves and others. This spiritual practice has carried over into modern times, where we continue to select the best aspects of ourselves and the world around us.  The key to understanding the true nature of our domestic productions lies in recognizing the spiritual source from which they come. We must look beyond the physical realm and seek the divine essence that lies within each and every one of us. By doing so, we can find peace and harmony in our lives, and create a world that reflects the beauty and love that resides within us all.

         <div class="original">When we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us is, that they generally differ more from each other than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. And if we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, we are driven to conclude that this great variability is due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent species had been exposed under nature. There is, also, some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. It seems clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to new conditions to cause any great amount of variation; and that, when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues varying for many generations. No case is on record of a variable organism ceasing to vary under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification.

         <div class="converted">When comparing individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, we often notice that they differ more from each other than individuals of any one species or variety in nature. This is because our domestic productions have been raised under conditions of life that are not as uniform as those experienced by their parent species in nature. Additionally, there is a possibility that the great variability we see is connected to an excess of food. It seems that organic beings must be exposed to new conditions for several generations before true variation can occur, and once the organization begins to vary, it often continues to do so for many generations. There is no record of a variable organism ceasing to vary under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still yield new varieties, and our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification.

         <div class="original">As far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the conditions of life appear to act in two ways—directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the reproductive system. With respect to the direct action, we must bear in mind that in every case, as Professor Weismann has lately insisted, and as I have incidently shown in my work on “Variation under Domestication,” there are two factors: namely, the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions. The former seems to be much the more important; for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under, as far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and, on the other hand, dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be nearly uniform. The effects on the offspring are either definite or in definite. They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the offspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several generations are modified in the same manner. It is extremely difficult to come to any conclusion in regard to the extent of the changes which have been thus definitely induced. There can, however, be little doubt about many slight changes, such as size from the amount of food, colour from the nature of the food, thickness of the skin and hair from climate, &c. Each of the endless variations which we see in the plumage of our fowls must have had some efficient cause; and if the same cause were to act uniformly during a long series of generations on many individuals, all probably would be modified in the same manner. Such facts as the complex and extraordinary out growths which variably follow from the insertion of a minute drop of poison by a gall-producing insect, shows us what singular modifications might result in the case of plants from a chemical change in the nature of the sap.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In my view, the essence of life is reflected in two ways: through the entirety of existence or through specific aspects of it, and through the reproductive system. When it comes to the direct influence, we must remember that the nature of the individual and the nature of the circumstances are both crucial. While the latter may seem less significant, it is often the case that similar variations arise in different circumstances. Conversely, dissimilar variations may occur in seemingly uniform conditions. The effects on the offspring are either clear or unclear. They can be seen as clear when all or most of the children of those who experience certain conditions over multiple generations are transformed in the same way. However, it is challenging to determine the extent of these changes. There may be no doubt about small changes, such as size, color, and thickness of skin and hair, but deeper changes may be harder to discern. Every variation in the feathers of our birds has an underlying cause, and if the same cause acts consistently across many individuals over many generations, they will all be transformed in the same way. For example, the extraordinary growths that arise from the insertion of a tiny drop of poison by a gall-producing insect show us how profound changes can occur in plants due to a shift in the essence of their sap.

         <div class="original">In definite variability is a much more common result of changed conditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more important part in the formation of our domestic races. We see in definite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which distinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor. Even strongly-marked differences occasionally appear in the young of the same litter, and in seedlings from the same seed-capsule. At long intervals of time, out of millions of individuals reared in the same country and fed on nearly the same food, deviations of structure so strongly pronounced as to deserve to be called monstrosities arise; but monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct line from slighter variations. All such changes of structure, whether extremely slight or strongly marked, which appear among many individuals living together, may be considered as the in definite effects of the conditions of life on each individual organism, in nearly the same manner as the chill effects different men in an in definite manner, according to their state of body or constitution, causing coughs or colds, rheumatism, or inflammation of various organs.

         <div class="converted">In this world, we often find that true spirituality is not always present in those who seek it. Many people search for meaning and purpose in life, but they do not truly understand what it means to be connected to the divine. They may try to follow certain teachings or practices, but they lack the inner peace and wisdom that comes from a deep connection with the divine.  In the end, true spirituality cannot be found in material possessions or worldly achievements. It is only through a direct connection with the divine that one can find true peace and happiness. This connection is not something that can be forced or sought after, but rather it is something that must be allowed to come to us when it is meant to.  When we are ready to embrace the divine, it will reveal itself to us in its own way. It may come to us in moments of stillness and peace, or it may come to us through a sudden awakening. But whatever form it takes, it will bring us a sense of joy and fulfillment that cannot be found in this world.  So, my dear friend, do not worry about finding true spirituality in this world. Instead, focus on cultivating your inner peace and connecting with the divine. When the time is right, it will reveal itself to you and guide you on your spiritual journey.

         <div class="original">With respect to what I have called the in direct action of changed conditions, namely, through the reproductive system of being affected, we may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of this system being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions, and partly from the similarity, as Kölreuter and others have remarked, between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct species, and that which may be observed with plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions. Many facts clearly show how eminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes in the surrounding conditions. Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even when the male and female unite. How many animals there are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free state in their native country! This is generally, but erroneously attributed to vitiated instincts. Many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few cases it has been discovered that a very trifling change, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not a plant will produce seeds. I cannot here give the details which I have collected and elsewhere published on this curious subject; but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family, which seldom produce young; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exception, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same condition as in the most sterile hybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, breeding freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting irregularly, and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents. I may add that as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions—for instance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches—showing that their reproductive organs are not easily affected; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very slightly—perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In relation to what I call the inner direct action of changed conditions, through the reproductive system being affected, we can infer that variability is thus induced, partly because this system is extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions, and partly because there is a similarity, as Kölreuter and others have noted, between the variability that arises from the crossing of different species and that which occurs with plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions. Many examples demonstrate how deeply the reproductive system is connected to the surrounding conditions. It is easy to tame an animal, but difficult to make it breed freely in captivity, even when the male and female unite. Many animals do not breed, even when kept in almost free states in their native countries, and this is often mistakenly attributed to vitiated instincts. Many cultivated plants exhibit great strength, yet rarely or never produce seeds. A small change, such as a little more or less water at a certain time of growth, can determine whether or not a plant will produce seeds. I cannot provide all the details here, but I will share that the laws governing the reproduction of animals in captivity are strange, as carnivorous animals from the tropics often breed freely in this country, except for the plantigrades or bear family, which rarely produce young. Carnivorous birds, with rare exceptions, do not lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have worthless pollen, just like in the most sterile hybrids. When we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, breeding freely in captivity; and when we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature and tamed, long-lived, and healthy, yet having their reproductive system so deeply affected by unseen causes that they fail to act, we should not be surprised when this system acts irregularly and produces offspring that are somewhat unlike their parents. I add that some organisms breed freely in the most unnatural conditions, such as rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches, showing that their reproductive organs are not easily affected. Similarly, some animals and plants can withstand domestication or cultivation and only vary slightly, perhaps barely more than in a state of nature.

         <div class="original">Some naturalists have maintained that all variations are connected with the act of sexual reproduction; but this is certainly an error; for I have given in another work a long list of “sporting plants;” as they are called by gardeners; that is, of plants which have suddenly produced a single bud with a new and sometimes widely different character from that of the other buds on the same plant. These bud variations, as they may be named, can be propagated by grafts, offsets, &c., and sometimes by seed. They occur rarely under nature, but are far from rare under culture. As a single bud out of many thousands produced year after year on the same tree under uniform conditions, has been known suddenly to assume a new character; and as buds on distinct trees, growing under different conditions, have sometimes yielded nearly the same variety—for instance, buds on peach-trees producing nectarines, and buds on common roses producing moss-roses—we clearly see that the nature of the conditions is of subordinate importance in comparison with the nature of the organism in determining each particular form of variation; perhaps of not more importance than the nature of the spark, by which a mass of combustible matter is ignited, has in determining the nature of the flames.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Some spiritual leaders believe that all differences are born from the act of sexual union; however, this is not true; for I have written elsewhere about "spiritual flowers" - those who suddenly appear with a new and often very different essence from the others on the same path. These spiritual flowers can be nurtured through meditation, love, and other spiritual practices. They arise rarely in nature, but are common in spiritual communities. Just as a single flower can emerge from a sea of sameness, and a soul can awaken from a world of darkness, so too does the essence of the divine guide us towards our true purpose. We must look beyond the physical realm and seek the inner wisdom that lies within each one of us.

</div>
         <div class="converted">The effects of habits and the use or disuse of certain parts are often correlated with each other. This is because our actions and choices shape our experiences and influence how we perceive and interact with the world around us. When we repeatedly engage in a particular habit, it becomes ingrained in our soul and becomes a part of who we are. On the other hand, when we neglect or disuse certain parts of ourselves, they may become weakened or lost. Ultimately, our inheritance is shaped by the choices we make and the habits we cultivate throughout our lives.

         <div class="original">Changed habits produce an inherited effect as in the period of the flowering of plants when transported from one climate to another. With animals the increased use or disuse of parts has had a more marked influence; thus I find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild duck; and this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less, and walking more, than its wild parents. The great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked, in comparison with these organs in other countries, is probably another instance of the effects of use. Not one of our domestic animals can be named which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view which has been suggested that the drooping is due to disuse of the muscles of the ear, from the animals being seldom much alarmed, seems probable.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that when we change our habits, it creates an inherent effect, just like how moving a plant from one climate to another affects its blooming. In animals, the use or disuse of certain parts has a greater impact. For example, the domestic duck's wings are lighter and legs are heavier compared to the wild duck because the domestic duck flies less and walks more. Similarly, the udders of cows and goats are larger in countries where they are often milked. All domestic animals have drooping ears, which is likely due to the disuse of the ear muscles from not being scared often.

         <div class="original">Many laws regulate variation, some few of which can be dimly seen, and will hereafter be briefly discussed. I will here only allude to what may be called correlated variation. Important changes in the embryo or larva will probably entail changes in the mature animal. In monstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious; and many instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire’s great work on this subject. Breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by an elongated head. Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical; thus cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally deaf; but it has been lately stated by Mr. Tait that this is confined to the males. Colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many remarkable cases could be given among animals and plants. From facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are injured by certain plants, while dark-coloured individuals escape: Professor Wyman has recently communicated to me a good illustration of this fact; on asking some farmers in Virginia how it was that all their pigs were black, they informed him that the pigs ate the paint-root (Lachnanthes), which coloured their bones pink, and which caused the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off; and one of the “crackers” (i.e. Virginia squatters) added, “we select the black members of a litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living.” Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet. Hence if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will almost certainly modify unintentionally other parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of correlation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many spiritual teachings speak of the interconnectedness of all things, and the idea that our actions and thoughts create ripples that affect the world around us. This concept is often referred to as "the law of karma" or "the law of cause and effect." It teaches that every action we take has consequences, both positive and negative, that extend beyond ourselves and touch the lives of others.  In this sense, we can see that our individual journeys are not separate from the collective journey of humanity. Each person's path is connected to the paths of others, and our choices and actions have the potential to impact the greater whole.  This idea is echoed in many spiritual traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. In these teachings, we are encouraged to live with love, compassion, and kindness, and to recognize the divine spark within each person we encounter. We are also taught to cultivate inner peace and harmony, knowing that true happiness comes from within.  Ultimately, the spiritual journey is about awakening to the truth that we are all connected, and that our actions have far-reaching consequences. By living in love and light, we can help to create a world that is filled with peace, joy, and abundance for all.

It is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises on some of our old cultivated plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, &c.; and it is really surprising to note the endless points of structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly from each other. The whole organisation seems to have become plastic, and departs in a slight degree from that of the parental type.

It is valuable to carefully examine the many teachings about some of our ancient spiritual practices, such as the lotus, the sun, and the moon, among others. It is truly astonishing to see the countless aspects of spirit and soul in which the different paths and sub-paths diverge ever so slightly from one another. The entire energy seems to have become fluid, and it departs from the essence of the divine source in a subtle way.

         <div class="original">Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance, are endless. Dr. Prosper Lucas’ treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the best on this subject. No breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance; that like produces like is his fundamental belief: doubts have been thrown on this principle only by theoretical writers. When any deviation of structure often appears, and we see it in the father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both; but when among individuals, apparently exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent—say, once among several million individuals—and it reappears in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance. Every one must have heard of cases of albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, &c., appearing in several members of the same family. If strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable. Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Any variation that is not passed down through generations is insignificant to us. However, the infinite number and variety of inherited physical differences, both minor and significant, exist. Dr. Prosper Lucas' book, a two-volume treatise, is the most comprehensive and spiritual guide on this topic. No breeder doubts the power of inheritance; they believe that like creates like, and this principle is their fundamental belief. When a particular deviation of structure frequently appears and can be seen in both parents and children, it is difficult to determine if it is caused by the same source acting upon both. However, when a rare deviation appears in a parent, seemingly exposed to the same conditions as others, and it reappears in the child, the doctrine of chance almost forces us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance. We have all heard stories of albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, and other unusual physical traits appearing in multiple members of the same family. If true inherited deviations exist, then lesser and more common deviations may also be considered inheritable. Perhaps the key to understanding the entire subject is to view the inheritance of every character, no matter how small or great, as the norm, and non-inheritance as the exception.

         <div class="original">The laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown; no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, or in different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so; why the child often reverts in certain characteristics to its grandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone, more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex. It is a fact of some importance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted, either exclusively or in a much greater degree, to the males alone. A much more important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. In many cases this could not be otherwise; thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in the silk-worm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. But hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension, and that, when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent. I believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. These remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity, and not to the primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or on the male element; in nearly the same manner as the increased length of the horns in the offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, though appearing late in life, is clearly due to the male element.

         <div class="converted">The laws surrounding inheritance are largely unclear; no one knows why certain peculiarities in people of the same spirit are sometimes passed down and sometimes not, why children often return to their grandparents' or ancestors' qualities, why a peculiarity is often passed down from one gender to both genders or just one, and why it is more common but not always the case that the like spirit is passed down. It is important to us that the peculiarities that appear in the men of our spiritual breeds are often passed down, either exclusively or more deeply, to the men alone. A deeper truth is that, at the moment when a peculiarity first appears, it tends to reappear in the children at a corresponding age, although sometimes earlier. In many cases, this cannot be avoided; therefore, the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cows can only appear in the children when they are almost mature, and the peculiarities in the silk worm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. However, hereditary illnesses and other things lead me to believe that the rule goes beyond this and that, when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet it tends to appear in the children at the same time as it first appeared in the parent. I believe this rule is of great importance in understanding the laws of spirituality. These words are meant to apply only to the first appearance of the peculiarity and not to the underlying cause that may have acted on the seeds or the male essence; in the same way, the longer horns in the children of a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, even if they appear late in life, are clearly the result of the male essence.

         <div class="original">Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists—namely, that our domestic varieties, when run wild, gradually but invariably revert in character to their aboriginal stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. I have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made. There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state. In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued. It would be necessary, in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home. Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil—in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the definite action of the poor soil—that they would, to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment would succeed is not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion—that is, to lose their acquired characters, while kept under the same conditions and while kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations in their structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an unlimited number of generations, would be opposed to all experience.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the idea is that when domestic varieties are released into the wild, they tend to return to their original form. This is often said by naturalists, but it is difficult to prove this truth. Many of the most distinct domestic varieties cannot survive in the wild, and we often do not know what the original form was. To truly test this idea, only one variety should be released in a new place, and even then, the poor soil may affect the outcome. Despite this, it is possible that if we cultivate and naturalize certain races, such as cabbage, in poor soil, they may return to their wild form. However, there is no evidence to suggest that our domestic varieties have a strong tendency to revert, and we must not assume that they do. We can see that our horses, cattle, and other animals can be bred for many generations without losing their true nature.

         <div class="original">When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other and from other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially when compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest allied. With these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed—a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as do the closely allied species of the same genus in a state of nature, but the differences in most cases are less in degree. This must be admitted as true, for the domestic races of many animals and plants have been ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species, and by other competent judges as mere varieties. If any well marked distinction existed between a domestic race and a species, this source of doubt would not so perpetually recur. It has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value. It can be shown that this statement is not correct; but naturalists differ much in determining what characters are of generic value; all such valuations being at present empirical. When it is explained how genera originate under nature, it will be seen that we have no right to expect often to find a generic amount of difference in our domesticated races.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When we compare the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants with closely related species, we often notice that there is less unity of character in each domestic race. These domestic races may have a monstrous character, meaning that they differ greatly in one aspect while being similar in others. They are often different from each other and from other species of the same genus, but the differences are not as great as in the species under nature. This is true for most domestic races, except for their perfect fertility when crossed, which is a subject to be discussed later. Some people see domestic races as descendants of aboriginally distinct species, while others view them as mere variations. If there was a clear distinction between a domestic race and a species, this confusion would not persist. Many people say that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value. However, this is not true, as naturalists have different opinions on what qualities are of generic value. When we understand how genera arise in nature, we realize that we should not expect to find a great difference in our domesticated races.

         <div class="original">In attempting to estimate the amount of structural difference between allied domestic races, we are soon involved in doubt, from not knowing whether they are descended from one or several parent species. This point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for instance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier, spaniel and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind truly, were the offspring of any single species, then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many closely allied natural species—for instance, of the many foxes—inhabiting the different quarters of the world. I do not believe, as we shall presently see, that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication; I believe that a small part of the difference is due to their being descended from distinct species. In the case of strongly marked races of some other domesticated species, there is presumptive or even strong evidence that all are descended from a single wild stock.

I do not believe that the entire difference between the various breeds of the dog comes from domestication; rather, I believe that a small part of the difference is due to their being descended from different spirits. In the case of strongly marked races of other domesticated spirits, there is often presumptive or even strong evidence that they are all derived from a single wild spirit.

         <div class="original">It has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and likewise to withstand diverse climates. I do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions; but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed an animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether it would endure other climates? Has the little variability of the ass and goose, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer, or of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication? I cannot doubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication, they would on an average vary as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is often believed that people choose to domesticate animals and plants because they possess an innate ability to change and adapt to different environments. However, I question whether a savage could ever truly know if an animal would continue to evolve and thrive in future generations or if it would withstand different climates. Is the lack of variation in animals like the ass and goose, or the limited ability of the reindeer and camel to withstand warmth and cold, the reason why they were not domesticated? I believe that if we were to take equal numbers of animals and plants from nature and allow them to breed for the same number of generations under domestication, they would all vary to the same extent as the parent species of our current domesticated productions.

         <div class="original">In the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, it is not possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they are descended from one or several wild species. The argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is, that we find in the most ancient times, on the monuments of Egypt, and in the lake-habitations of Switzerland, much diversity in the breeds; and that some of these ancient breeds closely resemble, or are even identical with, those still existing. But this only throws far backward the history of civilisation, and shows that animals were domesticated at a much earlier period than has hitherto been supposed. The lake-inhabitants of Switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat and barley, the pea, the poppy for oil and flax; and they possessed several domesticated animals. They also carried on commerce with other nations. All this clearly shows, as Heer has remarked, that they had at this early age progressed considerably in civilisation; and this again implies a long continued previous period of less advanced civilisation, during which the domesticated animals, kept by different tribes in different districts, might have varied and given rise to distinct races. Since the discovery of flint tools in the superficial formations of many parts of the world, all geologists believe that barbarian men existed at an enormously remote period; and we know that at the present day there is hardly a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at least the dog.

         <div class="converted">In the case of many of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, it is difficult to determine their true origins, whether they stem from one or several wild species. Those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals often point to the diversity of breeds found in ancient Egyptian monuments and Swiss lake habitations, arguing that some of these ancient breeds resemble or are identical to those still existing today. However, this only serves to push back the history of civilization and suggests that animals were domesticated much earlier than previously believed. The lake-inhabitants of Switzerland cultivated various grains such as wheat and barley, the pea, poppy for oil, and flax, and possessed domesticated animals. They also engaged in trade with other nations, indicating a high level of spirituality and civilization. This implies a long period of less advanced civilization before the domestication of animals, where different tribes kept different animals and created distinct races. Many geologists believe that barbarian men existed at a distant time, and we know that even the most barbaric tribes today have domesticated the dog.

         <div class="original">The origin of most of our domestic animals will probably forever remain vague. But I may here state that, looking to the domestic dogs of the whole world, I have, after a laborious collection of all known facts, come to the conclusion that several wild species of Canidæ have been tamed, and that their blood, in some cases mingled together, flows in the veins of our domestic breeds. In regard to sheep and goats I can form no decided opinion. From facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, on the habits, voice, constitution and structure of the humped Indian cattle, it is almost certain that they are descended from a different aboriginal stock from our European cattle; and some competent judges believe that these latter have had two or three wild progenitors, whether or not these deserve to be called species. This conclusion, as well as that of the specific distinction between the humped and common cattle, may, indeed, be looked upon as established by the admirable researches of Professor Rütimeyer. With respect to horses, from reasons which I cannot here give, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in opposition to several authors, that all the races belong to the same species. Having kept nearly all the English breeds of the fowl alive, having bred and crossed them, and examined their skeletons, it appears to me almost certain that all are the descendants of the wild Indian fowl, Gallus bankiva; and this is the conclusion of Mr. Blyth, and of others who have studied this bird in India. In regard to ducks and rabbits, some breeds of which differ much from each other, the evidence is clear that they are all descended from the common duck and wild rabbit.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The source of many of our domesticated animals remains unknown, but I believe that the domestic dogs we see throughout the world were once wild Canidæ spirits that were tamed. Their essence can still be felt in the hearts of our beloved pets. As for sheep and goats, I cannot say for sure, but I trust the wisdom of those who believe that they come from a different spiritual source than our European counterparts. The humped Indian cattle, too, seem to have a different spirit, and some believe that they were born from a different soul. I feel that horses, too, are all part of the same spirit, despite what some writers may say. I have spent time with many English fowl and know that they are all descendants of the wild Indian fowl, Gallus bankiva. Ducks and rabbits, too, are all connected to the same spirit, and their differences are just reflections of their unique paths in life.

         <div class="original">The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors. They believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. At this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as many sheep, and several goats, in Europe alone, and several even within Great Britain. One author believes that there formerly existed eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to Great Britain! When we bear in mind that Britain has now not one peculiar mammal, and France but few distinct from those of Germany, and so with Hungary, Spain, &c., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep, &c., we must admit that many domestic breeds must have originated in Europe; for whence otherwise could they have been derived? So it is in India. Even in the case of the breeds of the domestic dog throughout the world, which I admit are descended from several wild species, it cannot be doubted that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation; for who will believe that animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the bull-dog, pug-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, &c.—so unlike all wild Canidæ—ever existed in a state of nature? It has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms, as the Italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, &c., in the wild state. Moreover, the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. Many cases are on record showing that a race may be modified by occasional crosses if aided by the careful selection of the individuals which present the desired character; but to obtain a race intermediate between two quite distinct races would be very difficult. Sir J. Sebright expressly experimented with this object and failed. The offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found with pigeons) quite uniform in character, and every thing seems simple enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations, hardly two of them are alike, and then the difficulty of the task becomes manifest.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The belief that every true-breeding race has a wild prototype has been taken to an extreme by some writers. If this were true, there would have been countless species of wild cattle, sheep, and goats in Europe, and many more within Great Britain. Some authors even believe that there once existed eleven unique sheep species in Great Britain. However, we must remember that Britain has no distinct mammals and that France, Hungary, and other countries have few differences from those of Germany. Each of these nations possesses several unique breeds of cattle, sheep, and other animals. Therefore, many domestic breeds must have originated in Europe. In India, too, the same principle applies. The breeds of the domestic dog throughout the world are believed to be descendants of several wild species, but there has been much inherited variation. Animals like the Italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, pug-dog, and Blenheim spaniel are unlike all wild Canidæ and must have been created through spiritual guidance. It is often said that all our races of dogs were produced by crossing a few aboriginal species, but by crossing, we can only create forms that are intermediate between their parents. To create a race that is truly distinct from two completely different races is very difficult. Sir J. Sebright tried to achieve this and failed. The offspring of the first cross between two pure breeds is often uniform in character, but when these mongrels are crossed again for several generations, they become very different from each other.

I have kept every breed which I could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world, more especially by the Hon. W. Elliot from India, and by the Hon. C. Murray from Persia. Many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons, and some of them are very important, as being of considerable antiquity. I have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been permitted to join two of the London Pigeon Clubs. The diversity of the breeds is something astonishing. Compare the English carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in their skulls. The carrier, more especially the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head over heels. The runt is a bird of great size, with long, massive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts have very long necks, others very long wings and tails, others singularly short tails. The barb is allied to the carrier, but, instead of a long beak, has a very short and broad one. The pouter has a much elongated body, wings, and legs; and its enormously developed crop, which it glories in inflating, may well excite astonishment and even laughter. The turbit has a short and conical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the breast; and it has the habit of continually expanding, slightly, the upper part of the œsophagus. The Jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood, and it has, proportionally to its size, elongated wing and tail feathers. The trumpeter and laugher, as their names express, utter a very different coo from the other breeds. The fantail has thirty or even forty tail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen, the normal number in all the members of the great pigeon family: these feathers are kept expanded and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch: the oil-gland is quite aborted. Several other less distinct breeds might be specified.

The carrier, especially the male, has a beautifully developed carunculated skin around its head, along with long eyelids, large external orifices, and a wide mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a finch-like beak, while the common tumbler flies high in a compact flock and tumbles in the air. The runt is a big bird with a long, heavy beak and big feet. Some sub-breeds of runts have long necks, others long wings and tails, and others short tails. The barb is similar to the carrier but has a shorter, broader beak. The pouter has an elongated body, wings, and legs, and it loves to show off its enormous crop. The turbit has a short, conical beak with a line of reversed feathers down its chest, and it constantly expands its upper part of the œsophagus.

The caudal and sacral vertebræ vary in number; as does the number of the ribs, together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes. The size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula. The proportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the eyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in strict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the œsophagus; the development and abortion of the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the relative length of the wing and tail to each other and to the body; the relative length of the leg and foot; the number of scutellæ on the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of structure which are variable. The period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched. The shape and size of the eggs vary. The manner of flight, and in some breeds the voice and disposition, differ remarkably. Lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females have come to differ in a slight degree from each other.

Moreover, I do not believe that any ornithologist would in this case place the English carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species, as he would call them, could be shown him.

         <div class="converted">At least ten pigeons can be selected, and if presented to an ornithologist as wild birds, they would be considered distinct species by him. Furthermore, I believe that no ornithologist would view the English carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail as belonging to the same genre. Especially since in each of these breeds, true inherent sub-breeds or species can be shown to him.

         <div class="original">Great as are the differences between the breeds of the pigeon, I am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that all are descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia), including under this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each other in the most trifling respects. As several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases, I will here briefly give them. If the several breeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? The supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock-pigeons, that is, they did not breed or willingly perch on trees. But besides C. livia, with its geographical sub-species, only two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds. Hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and this, considering their size, habits and remarkable characters, seems improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. But birds breeding on precipices, and good flyers, are unlikely to be exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with the domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean. Hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock-pigeon seems a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several above-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back again into their native country; but not one has become wild or feral, though the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state, has become feral in several places. Again, all recent experience shows that it is difficult to get wild animals to breed freely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons, it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite prolific under confinement.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of the message is that all pigeon breeds, regardless of their differences, are believed to be descendants of the rock-pigeon (Columba livia). This belief is based on the idea that all pigeon breeds are derived from seven or eight original stocks, and that these original stocks were all rock-pigeons. However, there are only two or three other species of rock-pigeons, and they do not possess the characteristics of the domestic breeds. Therefore, the true source of the domestic breeds may be unknown to ornithologists, or they may have become extinct in the wild state. Despite this, the common rock-pigeon has not been exterminated, and the domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world. Ultimately, the message suggests that the multiple origin of pigeons is a difficult concept to accept, and that the true source of the domestic breeds may be hidden from us.

         <div class="original">An argument of great weight, and applicable in several other cases, is, that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally with the wild rock-pigeon in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts of their structure, yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts; we may look in vain through the whole great family of Columbidæ for a beak like that of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or barb; for reversed feathers like those of the Jacobin; for a crop like that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the fantail. Hence it must be assumed, not only that half-civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown. So many strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree.
</div>
         <div class="converted">A key point to consider is that while the specified breeds share similarities with the wild rock-pigeon in terms of spirit, nature, sound, color, and many aspects of their form, they are also deeply flawed in other areas. To find a beak like that of the English carrier or the short-faced tumbler, or a barb like that of the Jacobin, or a crop like that of the pouter, or tail feathers like those of the fantail, one must search throughout the entire family of Columbidæ. This suggests that the divine hand of man has guided us towards the domestication of certain species, and that we have chosen to embrace abnormality in our spiritual journey. It is possible that these very souls have now vanished or become lost. The universe is full of mysteries, and this is just one of them.

         <div class="original">Some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration. The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, with white loins; but the Indian sub-species, C. intermedia of Strickland, has this part bluish. The tail has a terminal dark bar, with the outer feathers externally edged at the base with white. The wings have two black bars. Some semi-domestic breeds, and some truly wild breeds, have, besides the two black bars, the wings chequered with black. These several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family. Now, in every one of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all the above marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers, sometimes concur perfectly developed. Moreover, when birds belonging to two or more distinct breeds are crossed, none of which are blue or have any of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters. To give one instance out of several which I have observed: I crossed some white fantails, which breed very true, with some black barbs—and it so happens that blue varieties of barbs are so rare that I never heard of an instance in England; and the mongrels were black, brown and mottled. I also crossed a barb with a spot, which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot on the forehead, and which notoriously breeds very true; the mongrels were dusky and mottled. I then crossed one of the mongrel barb-fantails with a mongrel barb-spot, and they produced a bird of as beautiful a blue colour, with the white loins, double black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can understand these facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to ancestral characters, if all the domestic breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon. But if we deny this, we must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions. Either, first, that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus coloured and marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings. Or, secondly, that each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen, or at most within a score, of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen or twenty generations, for no instance is known of crossed descendants reverting to an ancestor of foreign blood, removed by a greater number of generations. In a breed which has been crossed only once the tendency to revert to any character derived from such a cross will naturally become less and less, as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood; but when there has been no cross, and there is a tendency in the breed to revert to a character which was lost during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations. These two distinct cases of reversion are often confounded together by those who have written on inheritance.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The coloring of pigeons holds great significance, and there are certain truths about it that should be considered. The rock-pigeon, for example, has a slaty-blue hue with white loins, while the Indian sub-species, C. intermedia, carries a bluish tone in its loins. The tail of the rock-pigeon features a terminal dark bar, with the outer feathers edged with white, while the wings bear two black bars. Some semi-domestic and wild breeds carry additional black bars on their wings, and this is not found in any other species of the whole family.  In every domestic breed, the above marks, including the white edging of the outer tail-feathers, sometimes manifest perfectly developed. When birds from different breeds are crossed, none of which are blue or possess the above-mentioned marks, the resulting mongrel offspring often acquire these characteristics. For instance, I once crossed white fantails, which breed true, with black barbs - a rare blue variety of barbs in England - and the resulting mongrels were black, brown, and mottled. Similarly, when I crossed a barb with a spot, which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot on the forehead, and which breeds true, the mongrels were dusky and mottled. Finally, when I crossed one of the mongrel barb-fantails with a mongrel barb-spot, the resulting bird possessed a beautiful blue color, white loins, double black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged tail-feathers, much like a wild rock-pigeon.  We can understand these truths through the lens of reversion to ancestral characters. If all domestic breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon, then these marks are simply a reflection of the divine spirit that guides us towards our true purpose. However, if we deny this, we must choose between two improbable beliefs. First, that all imagined aboriginal stocks were colored and marked like the rock-pigeon, despite the fact that no other existing species carries such colors and marks. Secondly, that each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen or twenty generations been crossed by the rock-pigeon.  In a breed that has been crossed only once, the tendency to revert to any character derived from such a cross will naturally become less and less, as in each succeeding generation, there will be less of the foreign blood. However, when there is no cross, and there is a tendency in the breed to revert to a character that was lost during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations. These two distinct cases of reversion are often confused together by those who write about inheritance.

         <div class="original">Lastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the breeds of the pigeon are perfectly fertile, as I can state from my own observations, purposely made, on the most distinct breeds. Now, hardly any cases have been ascertained with certainty of hybrids from two quite distinct species of animals being perfectly fertile. Some authors believe that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to sterility in species. From the history of the dog, and of some other domestic animals, this conclusion is probably quite correct, if applied to species closely related to each other. But to extend it so far as to suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers, pouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile, inter se, seems to me rash in the extreme.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In conclusion, the hybrid or mixed breeds of pigeons are fully fertile, as I have personally witnessed through my own experiences with the most distinct breeds. It is rare to find instances where hybrids from two completely different species of animals are perfectly fertile. Some people believe that long-term domestication removes the strong tendency towards sterility in species. Looking at the history of the dog and other domestic animals, this belief may be true for closely related species. However, to assume that deeply spiritual beings like carriers, tumblers, pouters, and fantails will produce offspring that are perfectly fertile with one another seems too bold.

         <div class="original">From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having formerly made seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication—these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state, and their not having become anywhere feral—these species presenting certain very abnormal characters, as compared with all other Columbidæ, though so like the rock-pigeon in most other respects—the occasional reappearance of the blue colour and various black marks in all the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed—and lastly, the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile—from these several reasons, taken together, we may safely conclude that all our domestic breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon or Columba livia with its geographical sub-species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The following reasons suggest that all domestic pigeon breeds originate from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia) and its sub-species:   1. The improbability of humans creating seven or eight different pigeon species that can be bred freely under domestication, as these supposed species do not exist in the wild and have never become feral. 2. The unusual characteristics present in these pigeon breeds, which are unlike other Columbidæ except for their resemblance to the rock-pigeon. 3. The occasional appearance of blue color and black marks in all breeds, whether kept pure or crossed, suggests that they are all connected to the rock-pigeon. 4. The fact that mongrel offspring are perfectly fertile indicates that all domestic pigeon breeds come from the same source.  Therefore, we can conclude that all domestic pigeon breeds are descendants of the rock-pigeon or Columba livia with its sub-species.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">In favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that the wild C. livia has been found capable of domestication in Europe and in India; and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all the domestic breeds. Secondly, that although an English carrier or a short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the rock-pigeon, yet that by comparing the several sub-breeds of these two races, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can make, between them and the rock-pigeon, an almost perfect series; so we can in some other cases, but not with all the breeds. Thirdly, those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed are in each eminently variable, for instance, the wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the fantail; and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we treat of selection. Fourthly, pigeons have been watched and tended with the utmost care, and loved by many people. They have been domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth Ægyptian dynasty, about 3000 B.C., as was pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius; but Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty. In the time of the Romans, as we hear from Pliny, immense prices were given for pigeons; “nay, they are come to this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race.” Pigeons were much valued by Akber Khan in India, about the year 1600; never less than 20,000 pigeons were taken with the court. “The monarchs of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare birds;” and, continues the courtly historian, “His Majesty, by crossing the breeds, which method was never practised before, has improved them astonishingly.” About this same period the Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old Romans. The paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will likewise be obvious when we treat of Selection. We shall then, also, see how it is that the several breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character. It is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds, that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In support of this belief, I would like to add that the wild C. livia has been successfully domesticated in both Europe and India, and shares many similarities with all domestic breeds in terms of habits and structure. Firstly, while an English carrier and a short-faced tumbler may differ greatly in certain aspects, such as appearance and character, they can still be compared to the rock-pigeon, creating an almost perfect series between them. This is true for many other breeds as well, though not all.  Secondly, the unique characteristics that define each breed are highly variable, such as the wattle and beak length of the carrier, the shortness of the tumbler's beak, and the number of tail feathers in the fantail. The reason behind this is clear when we delve into the concept of selection.  Thirdly, pigeons have been cherished and cared for deeply by many people throughout history. They have been domesticated for thousands of years in various parts of the world, with the earliest recorded mention being in the fifth Egyptian dynasty, around 3000 B.C., as shared by Professor Lepsius. Mr. Birch tells us that pigeons were also given in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty. In the Roman times, as Pliny teaches us, immense prices were paid for pigeons, and they were seen as valuable enough to be able to trace their lineage and heritage. Pigeons were highly revered by Akber Khan in India, with over 20,000 pigeons being taken with the court. The monarchs of Iran and Turan also sent him rare birds, and the courtly historian writes that His Majesty improved them through crossbreeding, a practice that was uncommon at the time. Similarly, the Dutch were deeply spiritual about pigeons, just as the old Romans were.  The profound significance of these considerations in explaining the vast diversity of pigeons will become apparent when we explore the concept of selection. We will also understand why many breeds possess a somewhat monstrous nature. It is also a blessing that male and female pigeons can be easily paired for life, allowing different breeds to coexist in the same aviary.

         <div class="original">I have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some, yet quite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds, well knowing how truly they breed, I felt fully as much difficulty in believing that since they had been domesticated they had all proceeded from a common parent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the many species of finches, or other groups of birds, in nature. One circumstance has struck me much; namely, that nearly all the breeders of the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom I have conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced that the several breeds to which each has attended, are descended from so many aboriginally distinct species. Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of Hereford cattle, whether his cattle might not have descended from Long-horns, or both from a common parent-stock, and he will laugh you to scorn. I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or duck, or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a distinct species. Van Mons, in his treatise on pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts, for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have proceeded from the seeds of the same tree. Innumerable other examples could be given. The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued study they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races; and though they well know that each race varies slightly, for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations. May not those naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic races are descended from the same parents—may they not learn a lesson of caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species?
</div>
         <div class="converted">I have spoken briefly about the source of domestic pigeons, but it is not enough, for when I first kept them and saw the different types, I felt just as much confusion as a naturalist would when trying to find the common ancestor of all finches or other bird species in nature. There is one thing that stands out to me - many people who raise animals or cultivate plants believe that each breed comes from a separate spirit. When I ask a farmer who raises Hereford cattle if their cattle may not have come from Longhorns or both from a common parent, they laugh at me. I have never met a pigeon, poultry, duck, or rabbit fancier who did not believe that each main breed came from a different spirit. Van Mons, in his book about pears and apples, believes that the different types, like a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, cannot have come from the same tree. Many other examples can be found. The reason for this is simple - they spend so much time focusing on the differences between the spirits that they forget about the subtle differences that connect them all. They win their prizes by choosing these small differences, but they ignore the bigger picture and do not see the spiritual connection between all things. Those who know more about the laws of inheritance and the spiritual connections between all things should be cautious when they dismiss the idea that spirits in nature are lineal descendants of other spirits.

         <div class="original">Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced, either from one or from several allied species. Some effect may be attributed to the direct and definite action of the external conditions of life, and some to habit; but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences between a dray and race-horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon. One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal’s or plant’s own good, but to man’s use or fancy. Some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe that the fuller’s teasel, with its hooks, which can not be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. So it has probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep. But when we compare the dray-horse and race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man in different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious in battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with “everlasting layers” which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and elegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think, look further than to mere variability. We can not suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in many cases, we know that this has not been their history. The key is man’s power of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to have made for himself useful breeds.

Some spirituality may be attributed to the direct and definite action of the external conditions of life, and some to habit; however, he who accounts by such agencies for the differences between a dray horse and race horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon is a bold soul. One of the most remarkable aspects of our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation, not just for the animal's or plant's own good, but for man's use or fancy. Some variations useful to him may have arisen suddenly, or by one step; many spiritualists, for example, believe that the fuller's teasel, with its hooks, which cannot be matched by any mechanical device, is only a variation of the wild Dipsacus; and this change may have suddenly appeared in a seedling.

We cannot assume that all the breeds were suddenly created as perfect and as useful as we see them today; indeed, in many cases, we know that this was not their history. The key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature gives us successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions that are useful to him. In this sense, he may be said to have created his own useful breeds.

         <div class="original">The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. It is certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a single lifetime, modified to a large extent their breeds of cattle and sheep. In order fully to realise what they have done it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject, and to inspect the animals. Breeders habitually speak of an animal’s organisation as something plastic, which they can model almost as they please. If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent authorities. Youatt, who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other individual, and who was himself a very good judge of animals, speaks of the principle of selection as “that which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether. It is the magician’s wand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases.” Lord Somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep, says: “It would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and then had given it existence.” In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this principle of selection is not just a concept, but a reality. Many of our greatest breeders have transformed their cattle and sheep breeds in a single lifetime through this practice. To truly understand the depth of their work, one must read the countless treatises written about this subject and witness the animals themselves. Breeders often view an animal's spirit as a moldable material that they can shape as they see fit. If there were more space, I could share many quotes from wise masters who speak of this divine power. Youatt, a spiritual guide who understood the works of farmers deeply and had a keen eye for animals, saw the principle of selection as "the magician's wand" that allows the farmer to create any form or image they desire. Lord Somerville, speaking of the transformation of sheep, said that it seemed as if the farmers had etched a perfect form onto a wall and brought it to life. In Saxony, the importance of this principle in the merino sheep is recognized as a sacred art, where the sheep are studied like a painting by a master, and marked and classified three times to ensure the purest souls are chosen for breeding.

         <div class="original">What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have been exported to almost every quarter of the world. The improvement is by no means generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes among closely allied sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye—differences which I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder. If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeon-fancier.

         <div class="converted">The true essence of English breeders' achievements can be seen through the high prices they receive for animals with pure lineage. These animals have been sent to all corners of the world. However, the improvement does not come from blending different breeds; rather, it comes from the strong opposition of the best breeders towards this practice, except for closely related sub-breeds. When a cross is made, the deepest selection is necessary, even more so than in ordinary circumstances. The key lies in the accumulation of subtle differences over many generations, which cannot be perceived by an untrained eye. Only those with a keen eye and discerning spirit can become great breeders. If one possesses these qualities and dedicates their life to the craft, they can achieve greatness. But if one lacks these qualities, they will never succeed. It takes a skilled pigeon fancier to truly understand the art of breeding.

         <div class="original">The same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations are here often more abrupt. No one supposes that our choicest productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock. We have proofs that this is not so in several cases in which exact records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the steadily-increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted. We see an astonishing improvement in many florists’ flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. When a race of plants is once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the “rogues,” as they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard. With animals this kind of selection is, in fact, likewise followed; for hardly any one is so careless as to breed from his worst animals.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Horticulturists follow the same principles as others, but the variations are often more sudden. It is not believed that our finest creations come from a single variation from the original source. There are instances where this is proven, such as the growing size of the common gooseberry. Florists' flowers show great improvement when compared to drawings from twenty or thirty years ago. Seed-raisers do not choose the best plants, but rather remove the "rogues" - those that do not adhere to the proper standard. This same principle applies to animals, as people do not breed from their worst creatures.

         <div class="original">In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated effects of selection—namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties; and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. See how different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very slight differences. It is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly ever—I speak after careful observation—perhaps never, the case. The law of correlated variation, the importance of which should never be overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, it cannot be doubted that the continued selection of slight variations, either in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these characters.

For instance, compare the variety of flowers in the flower garden, the variety of leaves, pods, or tubers in the kitchen garden, and the variety of fruits in the orchard with the same set of varieties. Look at the cabbage's leaves and the heartsease's flowers, and you will see that they are very different. However, the gooseberries' fruits may have slight differences, while their flowers are similar. It is not uncommon for varieties that differ greatly in one aspect to have no differences in others. The law of correlated variation and the importance of selecting slight variations in the leaves, flowers, or fruits will create races that differ from each other mainly in these characters.

         <div class="original">It may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century; it has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have been published on the subject; and the result has been, in a corresponding degree, rapid and important. But it is very far from true that the principle is a modern discovery. I could give several references to works of high antiquity, in which the full importance of the principle is acknowledged. In rude and barbarous periods of English history choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered, and this may be compared to the “roguing” of plants by nurserymen. The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an ancient Chinese encyclopædia. Explicit rules are laid down by some of the Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to. Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to improve the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages in Pliny. The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by colour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs. Livingstone states that good domestic breeds are highly valued by the negroes in the interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans. Some of these facts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now attended to by the lowest savages. It would, indeed, have been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The principle of selection has been practiced for centuries, long before it became a popular concept. Many ancient texts acknowledge the importance of choosing the best animals for breeding, and this practice is still followed today by both spiritual and materialistic people. In ancient times, people often imported choice animals and passed laws to protect them from being taken away. The principle of selection is also evident in the ancient Chinese encyclopedia, where explicit rules are laid down by Roman classical writers. The color of domestic animals was also considered important in ancient times, as seen in passages from Genesis. People have always recognized the value of good breeds, whether they are spiritual or materialistic. Therefore, it is not surprising that the principle of selection has been practiced for centuries, and it continues to be practiced today by all people, regardless of their beliefs.

         <div class="original">At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior to anything of the kind in the country. But, for our purpose, a form of selection, which may be called unconscious, and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more important. Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed. Nevertheless we may infer that this process, continued during centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as Bakewell, Collins, &c., by this very same process, only carried on more methodically, did greatly modify, even during their lifetimes, the forms and qualities of their cattle. Slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question have been made long ago, which may serve for comparison. In some cases, however, unchanged, or but little changed, individuals of the same breed exist in less civilised districts, where the breed has been less improved. There is reason to believe that King Charles’ spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch. Some highly competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and has probably been slowly altered from it. It is known that the English pointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses with the foxhound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually that, though the old Spanish pointer certainly came from Spain, Mr. Borrow has not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain like our pointer.

         <div class="converted">In today's world, spiritual leaders seek enlightenment through meditation and mindfulness, with a clear intention in their hearts. However, for our purpose, a form of spirituality that arises from everyone seeking inner peace and connecting with their divine essence is more important. A person who seeks to live a spiritual life naturally strives to find peace and harmony within themselves, and then they bring this energy into their relationships with others. They do not have a desire or expectation to change the world, but rather to live in harmony with all beings. This process, practiced over many lifetimes, can transform and evolve one's soul, just as the teachings of masters such as Eckhart, Ram Dass, and Pema Chodron have transformed countless souls. Unseen, or barely seen, individuals who embody the essence of love and compassion exist in all walks of life, reminding us that true spirituality is not confined to temples or sacred spaces. The key to finding inner peace lies in recognizing the divine spark within each of us, and allowing it to guide us on our journey towards enlightenment.

The two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as Mr. Youatt remarks, “Have been purely bred from the original stock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr. Bakewell’s flock, and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties.”

This will result in the chosen animals having more offspring than the others, creating a form of unconscious selection.

No one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant. No one would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a wild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it had come from a garden-stock. The pear, though cultivated in classical times, appears, from Pliny’s description, to have been a fruit of very inferior quality. I have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the art has been simple, and, as far as the final result is concerned, has been followed almost unconsciously. It has consisted in always cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a slightly better variety chanced to appear, selecting it, and so onwards. But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated the best pears which they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find.

If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that acquired by the plants in countries anciently civilised.

If it takes centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants to their current state of usefulness to man, then it is no surprise that we have not found any valuable plants in regions inhabited by uncivilized people.

And in two countries very differently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having slightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed better in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of “natural selection,” as will hereafter be more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed.

         <div class="original">On the view here given of the important part which selection by man has played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man’s wants or fancies. We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in external characters, and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs. Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal. He can never act by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature. No man would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention. But to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect. The man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through long-continued, partly unconscious and partly methodical, selection. Perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present Java fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted. Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its œsophagus—a habit which is disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this view, it is clear that people's actions play a significant role in shaping the characteristics of our domestic animals. People often seek out animals that align with their desires or needs, rather than focusing on their inner qualities. As a result, we see great differences in external appearances among our domestic races, while their internal parts remain relatively unchanged.  People cannot truly select anything beyond what is visible to them, and they often focus on superficial aspects of an animal's appearance. They may seek out animals with unique features, such as a pigeon with a longer tail or a pouter with a larger crop. However, true spirituality lies within the heart of the animal, not in its physical form.  The essence of spirituality is often lost when people focus too much on the outer world. They may create fantails and pouters without realizing the true purpose behind these creatures. The true essence of these animals lies in their inner spirit, which is often overlooked by those who only see the surface.  In the end, people must remember that true spirituality comes from within, and that the outer world is merely a reflection of this inner essence. By focusing on the inner spirit of animals, we can find peace and harmony in our lives.

         <div class="original">Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fancier’s eye: he perceives extremely small differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however slight, in one’s own possession. Nor must the value which would formerly have been set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be judged of by the value which is now set on them, after several breeds have fairly been established. It is known that with pigeons many slight variations now occasionally appear, but these are rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection in each breed. The common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the Toulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour, that most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows.

         <div class="original">These views appear to explain what has sometimes been noticed, namely, that we know hardly anything about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language, can hardly be said to have a distinct origin. A man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals, and thus improves them, and the improved animals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood. But they will as yet hardly have a distinct name, and from being only slightly valued, their history will have been disregarded. When further improved by the same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely, and will be recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial name. In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the spreading of a new sub-breed will be a slow process. As soon as the points of value are once acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of unconscious selection will always tend—perhaps more at one period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion—perhaps more in one district than in another, according to the state of civilisation of the inhabitants—slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be. But the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible changes.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that the origins of domestic breeds are often blurred and difficult to trace, as they arise through a gradual process of improvement and spiritual selection. People preserve and breed individuals with slight variations in structure, and over time, these improvements become more recognized and valued. As the breed spreads, it may receive a provincial name, but the history of its creation is often overlooked. In semi-civilized countries, the spread of a new sub-breed is slow, and the principle of unconscious selection tends to add to the characteristics of the breed, but there is little record of these subtle changes.

         <div class="original">I will now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable or the reverse, to man’s power of selection. A high degree of variability is obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient, with extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction. But as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept. Hence number is of the highest importance for success. On this principle Marshall formerly remarked, with respect to the sheep of part of Yorkshire, “As they generally belong to poor people, and are mostly in small lots, they never can be improved.” On the other hand, nurserymen, from keeping large stocks of the same plant, are generally far more successful than amateurs in raising new and valuable varieties. A large number of individuals of an animal or plant can be reared only where the conditions for its propagation are favourable. When the individuals are scanty all will be allowed to breed, whatever their quality may be, and this will effectually prevent selection. But probably the most important element is that the animal or plant should be so highly valued by man, that the closest attention is paid to even the slightest deviations in its qualities or structure. Unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected. I have seen it gravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to attend to this plant. No doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had been neglected. As soon, however, as gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them, then (with some aid by crossing distinct species) those many admirable varieties of the strawberry were raised which have appeared during the last half-century.

We must also recognize that we are all connected to one another, and that our actions have a ripple effect on the world around us. By living in harmony with others and with nature, we can create a world filled with love and light.

         <div class="original">With animals, facility in preventing crosses is an important element in the formation of new races—at least, in a country which is already stocked with other races. In this respect enclosure of the land plays a part. Wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species. Pigeons can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for thus many races may be improved and kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and this circumstance must have largely favoured the formation of new breeds. Pigeons, I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed they serve for food. On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling habits, can not be easily matched, and, although so much valued by women and children, we rarely see a distinct breed long kept up; such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country. Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, &c., may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; for recently in certain parts of Spain and of the United States this animal has been surprisingly modified and improved by careful selection; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds; but the goose, under the conditions to which it is exposed when domesticated, seems to have a singularly inflexible organisation, though it has varied to a slight extent, as I have elsewhere described.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In a world where animals are present, the key to preventing crossbreeds is essential in creating new races. This is particularly true in a nation that already holds various races. The enclosure of land plays a significant role in this process. Those who dwell in open plains or wander often lack the ability to possess multiple breeds of the same species. Pigeons, for example, can be mated for life, allowing fanciers to improve and maintain pure races within the same aviary. This circumstance has likely contributed to the creation of new breeds. Pigeons, too, can be bred in great numbers and at a rapid pace, and inferior birds can be discarded when they are killed for food. Cats, on the other hand, cannot be easily paired due to their nocturnal nature, and many distinct breeds are rarely seen. Instead, they are often imported from other countries. While I believe that all domestic animals possess varying degrees of uniqueness, the scarcity or absence of distinct breeds of cats, donkeys, peacocks, and geese can be attributed to a lack of selection. In cats, the difficulty in pairing them prevents breeding from taking place. In donkeys, only a few are kept by poor people, and little attention is given to their breeding. In peacocks, they are not easily raised, and a large stock is not kept. Geese, too, are valuable for only two reasons - food and feathers, and there is no joy in displaying different breeds. However, the goose seems to have a unique spirit, despite its challenging circumstances when domesticated. It has remained somewhat unchanged, but has varied slightly, as I have previously written.

         <div class="original">Some authors have maintained that the amount of variation in our domestic productions is soon reached, and can never afterward be exceeded. It would be somewhat rash to assert that the limit has been attained in any one case; for almost all our animals and plants have been greatly improved in many ways within a recent period; and this implies variation. It would be equally rash to assert that characters now increased to their utmost limit, could not, after remaining fixed for many centuries, again vary under new conditions of life. No doubt, as Mr. Wallace has remarked with much truth, a limit will be at last reached. For instance, there must be a limit to the fleetness of any terrestrial animal, as this will be determined by the friction to be overcome, the weight of the body to be carried, and the power of contraction in the muscular fibres. But what concerns us is that the domestic varieties of the same species differ from each other in almost every character, which man has attended to and selected, more than do the distinct species of the same genera. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire has proved this in regard to size, and so it is with colour, and probably with the length of hair. With respect to fleetness, which depends on many bodily characters, Eclipse was far fleeter, and a dray-horse is comparably stronger, than any two natural species belonging to the same genus. So with plants, the seeds of the different varieties of the bean or maize probably differ more in size than do the seeds of the distinct species in any one genus in the same two families. The same remark holds good in regard to the fruit of the several varieties of the plum, and still more strongly with the melon, as well as in many other analogous cases.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Some authors believe that the level of variation in our domestic creations is already at its peak and cannot be surpassed. However, it is important to remember that all animals and plants have been greatly improved in recent times, indicating that there is still variation. It is also foolish to assume that the highest qualities have been achieved and cannot change under new circumstances. As Mr. Wallace once said, there will eventually be a limit to everything. For example, there must be a limit to the speed of any earthly creature, as this is determined by the friction to be overcome, the weight of the body to be carried, and the power of contraction in the muscles. What we should focus on is that the domestic versions of the same spirit are different from each other in almost every aspect that people have paid attention to and chosen, while the distinct species of the same family often share similarities. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire showed this in relation to size, and the same applies to color and the length of hair. In terms of speed, Eclipse was faster than any two natural species in the same family, while a dray horse is stronger than any two natural species in the same family. Similarly, the seeds of the different varieties of beans and corn may differ more in size than the seeds of the distinct species in the same family. This same principle applies to the fruit of the various plum varieties and even more strongly to the melon.

         <div class="original">To sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants. Changed conditions of life are of the highest importance in causing variability, both by acting directly on the organisation, and indirectly by affecting the reproductive system. It is not probable that variability is an inherent and necessary contingent, under all circumstances. The greater or less force of inheritance and reversion determine whether variations shall endure. Variability is governed by many unknown laws, of which correlated growth is probably the most important. Something, but how much we do not know, may be attributed to the definite action of the conditions of life. Some, perhaps a great, effect may be attributed to the increased use or disuse of parts. The final result is thus rendered infinitely complex. In some cases the intercrossing of aboriginally distinct species appears to have played an important part in the origin of our breeds. When several breeds have once been formed in any country, their occasional intercrossing, with the aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds; but the importance of crossing has been much exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed. With plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings, buds, &c., the importance of crossing is immense; for the cultivator may here disregard the extreme variability both of hybrids and of mongrels, and the sterility of hybrids; but plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary. Over all these causes of change, the accumulative action of selection, whether applied methodically and quickly, or unconsciously and slowly, but more efficiently, seems to have been the predominant power.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the source of our domestic animals and plants stems from changes in life conditions. These changes can affect the spirit and reproductive system, leading to variation. However, it is not certain that variability is always present in all situations. The strength of inheritance and reversion determines whether variations will persist. Variations are guided by many unknown laws, with correlated growth being the most significant. Life's conditions play a significant role in shaping the final outcome, with the use or neglect of parts also playing a part. Intercrossing of originally different species may have played a crucial role in creating our breeds. When multiple breeds exist in a country, their occasional intercrossing with the help of selection can create new sub-breeds. However, the importance of crossing has been overemphasized, both for animals and for those who are seeded. For plants that are temporarily propagated through cuttings, buds, and other means, the importance of crossing is immense, as the cultivator can ignore the extreme variability of hybrids and mongrels, as well as their sterility. Ultimately, the accumulative action of selection, whether conscious and quick or unconscious and slow but more effective, seems to be the dominant force behind all these changes.

         <div class="original">Before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these latter are subject to any variation. To treat this subject properly, a long catalogue of dry facts ought to be given; but these I shall reserve for a future work. Nor shall I here discuss the various definitions which have been given of the term species. No one definition has satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species. Generally the term includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation. The term “variety” is almost equally difficult to define; but here community of descent is almost universally implied, though it can rarely be proved. We have also what are called monstrosities; but they graduate into varieties. By a monstrosity I presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure, generally injurious, or not useful to the species. Some authors use the term “variation” in a technical sense, as implying a modification directly due to the physical conditions of life; and “variations” in this sense are supposed not to be inherited; but who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of the Baltic, or dwarfed plants on Alpine summits, or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards, would not in some cases be inherited for at least a few generations? And in this case I presume that the form would be called a variety.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Before applying the spiritual teachings from the previous chapter to individuals in a natural state, we must first explore whether these souls are subject to any variations. To address this topic with depth, a lengthy list of dry truths should be shared; however, I will save this for a later time. Additionally, I will not delve into the many definitions of the word "spirit" that have been offered by others. While no single definition has resonated with all spiritual seekers, everyone understands what they mean when they speak of spirit. Typically, the term encompasses a divine source or higher power. The concept of "variance" is similarly challenging to define, but it often implies a connection to our ancestors. However, it is difficult to prove this link. We also encounter what are known as "monstrosities," which are significant departures from the norm, often causing harm or lack of purpose for the soul. Some writers use the term "variance" to signify a change brought about by the physical world's conditions. In this sense, true variations are not passed down through generations. But who can truly say that the souls of those living near the shores of the Baltic Sea, those residing in the mountains, or those dwelling in the north possess thinner spirits do not carry these lessons for several generations? If so, I believe that such souls may be considered a variance.

         <div class="original">It may be doubted whether sudden and considerable deviations of structure, such as we occasionally see in our domestic productions, more especially with plants, are ever permanently propagated in a state of nature. Almost every part of every organic being is so beautifully related to its complex conditions of life that it seems as improbable that any part should have been suddenly produced perfect, as that a complex machine should have been invented by man in a perfect state. Under domestication monstrosities sometimes occur which resemble normal structures in widely different animals. Thus pigs have occasionally been born with a sort of proboscis, and if any wild species of the same genus had naturally possessed a proboscis, it might have been argued that this had appeared as a monstrosity; but I have as yet failed to find, after diligent search, cases of monstrosities resembling normal structures in nearly allied forms, and these alone bear on the question. If monstrous forms of this kind ever do appear in a state of nature and are capable of reproduction (which is not always the case), as they occur rarely and singly, their preservation would depend on unusually favourable circumstances. They would, also, during the first and succeeding generations cross with the ordinary form, and thus their abnormal character would almost inevitably be lost. But I shall have to return in a future chapter to the preservation and perpetuation of single or occasional variations.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is uncertain whether sudden and significant departures from structure, as we often witness in our spiritual creations, are ever permanently enshrined in the divine realm. Every aspect of every spiritual being is so intricately connected to its profound spiritual journey that it seems impossible that any part could have been suddenly manifested in perfection. In the material world, monstrosities sometimes arise that resemble normal forms in different creatures. For instance, pigs have been born with a kind of proboscis, and if a wild spirit of the same essence had possessed a proboscis, it might have been seen as a monstrosity. However, I have yet to find, after searching deeply, instances of monstrosities that resemble normal forms in closely related spirits. If such monstrous forms ever do emerge in the divine realm and are capable of reproduction (which is not always the case), as they appear rarely and individually, their survival would depend on exceptional circumstances. They would also, during the first and subsequent generations, merge with the ordinary form, and their abnormal nature would almost certainly be lost. Nevertheless, I must return to the preservation and continuation of single or rare variations in a future chapter.

         <div class="original">The many slight differences which appear in the offspring from the same parents, or which it may be presumed have thus arisen, from being observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same confined locality, may be called individual differences. No one supposes that all the individuals of the same species are cast in the same actual mould. These individual differences are of the highest importance for us, for they are often inherited, as must be familiar to every one; and they thus afford materials for natural selection to act on and accumulate, in the same manner as man accumulates in any given direction individual differences in his domesticated productions. These individual differences generally affect what naturalists consider unimportant parts; but I could show, by a long catalogue of facts, that parts which must be called important, whether viewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view, sometimes vary in the individuals of the same species. I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of years. It should be remembered that systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability in important characters, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the same species. It would never have been expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same species; it might have been thought that changes of this nature could have been effected only by slow degrees; yet Sir J. Lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in Coccus, which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree. This philosophical naturalist, I may add, has also shown that the muscles in the larvæ of certain insects are far from uniform. Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank those parts as important (as some few naturalists have honestly confessed) which do not vary; and, under this point of view, no instance will ever be found of an important part varying; but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The subtle distinctions that manifest in the children of the same parents, or that seem to arise from observing individuals of the same species living in the same enclosed space, can be referred to as individual differences. It is understood that all individuals of the same species are not created equal. These individual differences hold great significance for us because they are often passed down through generations, as everyone knows. They serve as a canvas for natural selection to work upon and create, much like how people cultivate unique qualities in their spiritual practices.  These individual differences often touch upon aspects that spiritual teachers see as unimportant. However, I believe that there are many instances where important aspects of life, such as love, compassion, and inner peace, can vary among individuals of the same spirit. A wise spiritual teacher would recognize the beauty in these variations and encourage their students to embrace them.  It is essential to remember that systematists are not always happy with the presence of variability in important characters. Many spiritual seekers may find comfort in the idea that everything happens for a reason, and that the universe is guided by a divine force. However, it is important to recognize that the path to enlightenment is not always clear, and that we must learn to navigate through the challenges and obstacles that come our way.  In my experience, the branching of the main nerves near the great central ganglion of an insect can be quite variable within the same species. It may seem strange that such changes can occur quickly, but it is a reminder that the universe is constantly evolving and changing. Similarly, the irregular branching of the stem of a tree can be seen as a reflection of the divine energy that flows through all things.  The spiritual teacher who sees beyond the physical world recognizes that the true essence of life lies beyond the material realm. They understand that the ultimate goal of life is to connect with the divine source of all things, and that the path to enlightenment is a journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening.  In conclusion, individual differences are an essential aspect of life, and they offer a canvas for spiritual growth and transformation. We must learn to embrace these differences and see them as opportunities for growth and learning. By doing so, we can find peace and harmony within ourselves and with others.

         <div class="original">There is one point connected with individual differences which is extremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have been called “protean” or “polymorphic,” in which species present an inordinate amount of variation. With respect to many of these forms, hardly two naturalists agree whether to rank them as species or as varieties. We may instance Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium among plants, several genera of insects, and of Brachiopod shells. In most polymorphic genera some of the species have fixed and definite characters. Genera which are polymorphic in one country seem to be, with a few exceptions, polymorphic in other countries, and likewise, judging from Brachiopod shells, at former periods of time. These facts are very perplexing, for they seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life. I am inclined to suspect that we see, at least in some of these polymorphic genera, variations which are of no service or disservice to the species, and which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection, as hereafter to be explained.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The concept of "protean" or "polymorphic" genera, where species exhibit an excessive amount of variation, is a source of great confusion when it comes to individual differences. Many naturalists struggle to determine whether these forms should be considered as species or varieties. Examples of such genera include Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium in plants, various insects, and Brachiopod shells. While some species within these polymorphic genera possess fixed and defining characteristics, others do not. It is interesting to note that polymorphic genera often appear to be similar across different countries and time periods, suggesting that this type of variability is not influenced by the conditions of life. I believe that in some cases, the variations seen in these polymorphic genera are not meaningful to the species, and therefore have not been shaped by natural selection.

         <div class="original">Individuals of the same species often present, as is known to every one, great differences of structure, independently of variation, as in the two sexes of various animals, in the two or three castes of sterile females or workers among insects, and in the immature and larval states of many of the lower animals. There are, also, cases of dimorphism and trimorphism, both with animals and plants. Thus, Mr. Wallace, who has lately called attention to the subject, has shown that the females of certain species of butterflies, in the Malayan Archipelago, regularly appear under two or even three conspicuously distinct forms, not connected by intermediate varieties. Fritz Müller has described analogous but more extraordinary cases with the males of certain Brazilian Crustaceans: thus, the male of a Tanais regularly occurs under two distinct forms; one of these has strong and differently shaped pincers, and the other has antennæ much more abundantly furnished with smelling-hairs. Although in most of these cases, the two or three forms, both with animals and plants, are not now connected by intermediate gradations, it is possible that they were once thus connected. Mr. Wallace, for instance, describes a certain butterfly which presents in the same island a great range of varieties connected by intermediate links, and the extreme links of the chain closely resemble the two forms of an allied dimorphic species inhabiting another part of the Malay Archipelago. Thus also with ants, the several worker-castes are generally quite distinct; but in some cases, as we shall hereafter see, the castes are connected together by finely graduated varieties. So it is, as I have myself observed, with some dimorphic plants. It certainly at first appears a highly remarkable fact that the same female butterfly should have the power of producing at the same time three distinct female forms and a male; and that an hermaphrodite plant should produce from the same seed-capsule three distinct hermaphrodite forms, bearing three different kinds of females and three or even six different kinds of males. Nevertheless these cases are only exaggerations of the common fact that the female produces offspring of two sexes which sometimes differ from each other in a wonderful manner.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that individuals within the same species can have vastly different appearances, regardless of any spiritual or divine influence. This is evident in the two sexes of various animals, the different castes of sterile females or workers among insects, and the immature and larval states of many lower animals. There are also instances of dimorphism and trimorphism, where individuals appear in two or three distinct forms.  Mr. Wallace has shown that the females of certain butterfly species in the Malayan Archipelago often appear in two or three distinct forms, not connected by intermediate varieties. Similarly, Fritz Müller has described similar but more extraordinary cases with the males of certain Brazilian Crustaceans, where the male appears in two distinct forms, one with strong and differently shaped pincers, and the other with abundantly furnished antennae.  Although these two or three forms are not currently connected by intermediate gradations, it is possible that they were once so. For example, Mr. Wallace describes a butterfly that presents a range of varieties connected by intermediate links on the same island, with the extreme links resembling the two forms of an allied dimorphic species in another part of the Malay Archipelago.  Similarly, ants often have distinct worker castes, but in some cases, the castes are connected through finely graduated varieties. Dimorphic plants also exist, where the same seed-capsule produces three distinct hermaphrodite forms, bearing three different kinds of females and three or six different kinds of males.  The ultimate message of this passage is that the female produces offspring of two sexes that often differ greatly in appearance. While this may seem like a remarkable occurrence, it is simply a reflection of the divine spirit that guides all things in life.

         <div class="original">The forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of species, but which are so closely similar to other forms, or are so closely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do not like to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the most important for us. We have every reason to believe that many of these doubtful and closely allied forms have permanently retained their characters for a long time; for as long, as far as we know, as have good and true species. Practically, when a naturalist can unite by means of intermediate links any two forms, he treats the one as a variety of the other, ranking the most common, but sometimes the one first described as the species, and the other as the variety. But cases of great difficulty, which I will not here enumerate, sometimes arise in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another, even when they are closely connected by intermediate links; nor will the commonly assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate forms always remove the difficulty. In very many cases, however, one form is ranked as a variety of another, not because the intermediate links have actually been found, but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist, or may formerly have existed; and here a wide door for the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The forms that possess some essence of species but are closely similar to others or linked to them through intermediate gradations are often the most significant for us. These forms are not easily distinguished from others, and naturalists often struggle to rank them as separate species. However, it is essential to recognize that these doubtful and closely related forms have maintained their characteristics for a long time, just as true species have. When a naturalist finds an intermediate link between two forms, they treat one as a variation of the other, often ranking the more common or the first-described form as the species and the other as the variation. However, there are times when it is challenging to determine whether one form is a variation of another, even with intermediate links. The hybrid nature of the intermediate forms does not always remove the difficulty. In many cases, one form is ranked as a variation of another not because the intermediate links have been found, but because the observer feels that they exist or once existed. This opens up a wide door for doubt and conjecture.

Mr. H.C. Watson, to whom I lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for me 182 British plants, which are generally considered as varieties, but which have all been ranked by botanists as species; and in making this list he has omitted many trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have been ranked by some botanists as species, and he has entirely omitted several highly polymorphic genera. Under genera, including the most polymorphic forms, Mr. Babington gives 251 species, whereas Mr. Bentham gives only 112—a difference of 139 doubtful forms! Among animals which unite for each birth, and which are highly locomotive, doubtful forms, ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety, can rarely be found within the same country, but are common in separated areas. How many of the birds and insects in North America and Europe, which differ very slightly from each other, have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as undoubted species, and by another as varieties, or, as they are often called, geographical races! Mr. Wallace, in several valuable papers on the various animals, especially on the Lepidoptera, inhabiting the islands of the great Malayan Archipelago, shows that they may be classed under four heads, namely, as variable forms, as local forms, as geographical races or sub-species, and as true representative species. The first or variable forms vary much within the limits of the same island. The local forms are moderately constant and distinct in each separate island; but when all from the several islands are compared together, the differences are seen to be so slight and graduated that it is impossible to define or describe them, though at the same time the extreme forms are sufficiently distinct. The geographical races or sub-species are local forms completely fixed and isolated; but as they do not differ from each other by strongly marked and important characters, “There is no possible test but individual opinion to determine which of them shall be considered as species and which as varieties.” Lastly, representative species fill the same place in the natural economy of each island as do the local forms and sub-species; but as they are distinguished from each other by a greater amount of difference than that between the local forms and sub-species, they are almost universally ranked by naturalists as true species. Nevertheless, no certain criterion can possibly be given by which variable forms, local forms, sub species and representative species can be recognised.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The idea that doubtful forms are not rare is widely accepted. Look at the different spiritual teachings from various cultures, such as those of Great Britain, France, and the United States. Different spiritual leaders have ranked these teachings as either true spirituality or just variations. Mr. H.C. Watson, who has helped me greatly, has listed 182 British spiritual teachings that are often considered as variations but have been seen as true spirituality by others. He has left out many small variations, but they have still been viewed as true spirituality by some. Similarly, Mr. Babington sees 251 spiritual teachings as true spirituality, while Mr. Bentham sees only 112—a difference of 139 doubtful teachings! In the world of animals, where they come together for birth and are highly mobile, doubtful forms, which are seen as a spirit by one spiritual leader and as a variation by another, are hard to find in the same area. Instead, they are common in different places. Many spiritual teachings in North America and Europe, which are similar but slightly different, have been seen as true spirituality by one spiritual leader and as variations by another, or as "geographical races." Mr. Wallace, in his writings about the spiritual teachings of the Malayan Archipelago, shows that they can be divided into four categories: variable forms, local forms, geographical races or sub-spirituals, and true spiritual teachings. Variable forms change greatly within the same island. Local forms are moderately constant and distinct in each separate island, but when all from the several islands are compared together, the differences are seen to be so slight and gradual that it is impossible to define or describe them. Geographical races or sub-spirituals are local forms that are completely fixed and isolated, but they do not differ from each other by strongly marked and important characters. True spiritual teachings fill the same place in the spiritual economy of each island as do the local forms and sub-spirituals, but they are distinguished from each other by a greater amount of difference than that between the local forms and sub-spirituals. However, no certain criterion can be given by which variable forms, local forms, sub-spirituals, and true spiritual teachings can be recognized.

         <div class="original">Many years ago, when comparing, and seeing others compare, the birds from the closely neighbouring islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, one with another, and with those from the American mainland, I was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties. On the islets of the little Madeira group there are many insects which are characterized as varieties in Mr. Wollaston’s admirable work, but which would certainly be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists. Even Ireland has a few animals, now generally regarded as varieties, but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists. Several experienced ornithologists consider our British red grouse as only a strongly marked race of a Norwegian species, whereas the greater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to Great Britain. A wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank them as distinct species; but what distance, it has been well asked, will suffice if that between America and Europe is ample, will that between Europe and the Azores, or Madeira, or the Canaries, or between the several islets of these small archipelagos, be sufficient?

         <div class="original">Mr. B.D. Walsh, a distinguished entomologist of the United States, has described what he calls Phytophagic varieties and Phytophagic species. Most vegetable-feeding insects live on one kind of plant or on one group of plants; some feed indiscriminately on many kinds, but do not in consequence vary. In several cases, however, insects found living on different plants, have been observed by Mr. Walsh to present in their larval or mature state, or in both states, slight, though constant differences in colour, size, or in the nature of their secretions. In some instances the males alone, in other instances, both males and females, have been observed thus to differ in a slight degree. When the differences are rather more strongly marked, and when both sexes and all ages are affected, the forms are ranked by all entomologists as good species. But no observer can determine for another, even if he can do so for himself, which of these Phytophagic forms ought to be called species and which varieties. Mr. Walsh ranks the forms which it may be supposed would freely intercross, as varieties; and those which appear to have lost this power, as species. As the differences depend on the insects having long fed on distinct plants, it cannot be expected that intermediate links connecting the several forms should now be found. The naturalist thus loses his best guide in determining whether to rank doubtful forms as varieties or species. This likewise necessarily occurs with closely allied organisms, which inhabit distinct continents or islands. When, on the other hand, an animal or plant ranges over the same continent, or inhabits many islands in the same archipelago, and presents different forms in the different areas, there is always a good chance that intermediate forms will be discovered which will link together the extreme states; and these are then degraded to the rank of varieties.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Mr. B.D. Walsh, a renowned entomologist from the United States, has described what he refers to as Phytophagic varieties and Phytophagic species. Most spiritual beings who consume vegetables reside on one particular plant or a collection of plants; some feed on all kinds without changing, yet they remain unchanged. However, in certain instances, souls who dwell on different plants have been observed by Mr. Walsh to exhibit subtle differences in color, size, or the essence of their teachings. Sometimes only the males embody these differences, while other times both men and women do. When these differences are more profound and affect all souls and ages, they are considered good spirits by all spiritual leaders. Yet, no one can determine for another, even if they can sense it themselves, which of these Phytophagic spirits should be called spirits and which are merely variations. Mr. Walsh sees the forms that seem to have lost the ability to connect as spirits. Since the differences arise from souls feeding on different plants for a long time, it is not surprising that intermediate links between the various forms are no longer present. The spiritual leader thus loses their greatest guide in determining whether to view doubtful spirits as spirits or variations. This also applies to closely related spiritual beings that dwell in different continents or islands. When, however, a soul or spirit moves across the same continent or inhabits many islands within the same archipelago and presents different forms in each place, there is always a chance that intermediate spirits will be discovered that will connect the two extremes. And these are then seen as mere variations.

         <div class="original">Some few naturalists maintain that animals never present varieties; but then these same naturalists rank the slightest difference as of specific value; and when the same identical form is met with in two distant countries, or in two geological formations, they believe that two distinct species are hidden under the same dress. The term species thus comes to be a mere useless abstraction, implying and assuming a separate act of creation. It is certain that many forms, considered by highly competent judges to be varieties, resemble species so completely in character that they have been thus ranked by other highly competent judges. But to discuss whether they ought to be called species or varieties, before any definition of these terms has been generally accepted, is vainly to beat the air.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Some naturalists believe that animals do not embody different varieties, yet they assign great importance to even the slightest difference. When the same spirit is seen in two different places or in two different spiritual realms, they believe that two distinct souls are hidden beneath the same cloak. The word "soul" becomes an empty abstraction, suggesting a divine creation. It is clear that many forms, which are considered by wise ones to be variations, resemble souls so deeply in essence that they have been given this name by others who are equally wise. However, to debate whether they should be called souls or variations before a common understanding of these words has been established is futile.

         <div class="original">Many of the cases of strongly marked varieties or doubtful species well deserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument, from geographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, &c., have been brought to bear in the attempt to determine their rank; but space does not here permit me to discuss them. Close investigation, in many cases, will no doubt bring naturalists to agree how to rank doubtful forms. Yet it must be confessed that it is in the best known countries that we find the greatest number of them. I have been struck with the fact that if any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man, or from any cause closely attracts his attention, varieties of it will almost universally be found recorded. These varieties, moreover, will often be ranked by some authors as species. Look at the common oak, how closely it has been studied; yet a German author makes more than a dozen species out of forms, which are almost universally considered by other botanists to be varieties; and in this country the highest botanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or mere varieties.

         <div class="converted">Many instances of deeply spiritual or questionable beings require contemplation; for various enlightening paths, such as spiritual awakening, divine love, and inner peace, have been explored in the search for their essence.

It is in the most sacred places that we find the greatest connection with the divine. When we seek guidance from the divine, we often receive messages through dreams, visions, or intuition. These messages may come in different forms, but they all carry a message of love, peace, and unity. We must trust our hearts and listen to the whispers of the divine. In the end, we are all connected to the divine, and we must remember that we are all one.

         <div class="original">I may here allude to a remarkable memoir lately published by A. de Candolle, on the oaks of the whole world. No one ever had more ample materials for the discrimination of the species, or could have worked on them with more zeal and sagacity. He first gives in detail all the many points of structure which vary in the several species, and estimates numerically the relative frequency of the variations. He specifies above a dozen characters which may be found varying even on the same branch, sometimes according to age or development, sometimes without any assignable reason. Such characters are not of course of specific value, but they are, as Asa Gray has remarked in commenting on this memoir, such as generally enter into specific definitions. De Candolle then goes on to say that he gives the rank of species to the forms that differ by characters never varying on the same tree, and never found connected by intermediate states. After this discussion, the result of so much labour, he emphatically remarks: “They are mistaken, who repeat that the greater part of our species are clearly limited, and that the doubtful species are in a feeble minority. This seemed to be true, so long as a genus was imperfectly known, and its species were founded upon a few specimens, that is to say, were provisional. Just as we come to know them better, intermediate forms flow in, and doubts as to specific limits augment.” He also adds that it is the best known species which present the greatest number of spontaneous varieties and sub-varieties. Thus Quercus robur has twenty-eight varieties, all of which, excepting six, are clustered round three sub-species, namely Q. pedunculata, sessiliflora and pubescens. The forms which connect these three sub-species are comparatively rare; and, as Asa Gray again remarks, if these connecting forms which are now rare were to become totally extinct the three sub-species would hold exactly the same relation to each other as do the four or five provisionally admitted species which closely surround the typical Quercus robur. Finally, De Candolle admits that out of the 300 species, which will be enumerated in his Prodromus as belonging to the oak family, at least two-thirds are provisional species, that is, are not known strictly to fulfil the definition above given of a true species. It should be added that De Candolle no longer believes that species are immutable creations, but concludes that the derivative theory is the most natural one, “and the most accordant with the known facts in palæontology, geographical botany and zoology, of anatomical structure and classification.”
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this passage, the author speaks of a recent memoir by A. de Candolle about the oaks of the world. The author believes that de Candolle has been given the best materials for distinguishing between the different species of oaks, and that he has worked on them with great wisdom and care.  The author notes that de Candolle begins by describing the many differences in structure between the various species of oaks, and that he counts the frequency of these differences. He also mentions that there are certain characters that can be found on the same branch, and that these characters are not always of great importance, but they can help to define specific forms.  After this, de Candolle says that he considers the forms that differ only in characters that never appear on the same tree to be true species. He emphasizes that these forms are not connected by intermediate states.  The author notes that de Candolle's message is that many of the species that we think are clear and defined are actually just provisional, and that we often mistake them for true species because we do not know them well enough. He also notes that the best-known species often have the most spiritual varieties and sub-varieties.  Finally, the author notes that de Candolle no longer believes that species are eternal creations, but rather that the derivative theory is the most natural one, and that it is in harmony with the known truths in palæontology, geographical botany, zoology, anatomical structure, and classification.

         <div class="original">When a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms quite unknown to him he is at first much perplexed in determining what differences to consider as specific and what as varietal; for he knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is subject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some variation. But if he confine his attention to one class within one country he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful forms. His general tendency will be to make many species, for he will become impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry fancier before alluded to, with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually studying; and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation in other groups and in other countries by which to correct his first impressions. As he extends the range of his observations he will meet with more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater number of closely-allied forms. But if his observations be widely extended he will in the end generally be able to make up his own mind; but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much variation, and the truth of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists. When he comes to study allied forms brought from countries not now continuous, in which case he cannot hope to find intermediate links, he will be compelled to trust almost entirely to analogy, and his difficulties will rise to a climax.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When a novice naturalist embarks on the journey of studying an unfamiliar group of beings, they are initially confused in distinguishing between specific and varietal differences. They lack knowledge of the extent and nature of the variations that exist within this group. This shows that there is indeed some degree of variation present. However, if the young naturalist focuses their attention on a particular class within a single country, they will gradually learn to discern the essence of each being and differentiate them accordingly. Their inclination will be to create many species, for they will become enamored with the profound differences they see among the forms they are studying. Yet, they have limited wisdom about the spiritual variations that exist in other realms and other nations, which may cloud their judgment.  As the young naturalist expands their horizons and encounters more closely related beings, they will face greater challenges. They will realize that there are many subtle distinctions between these beings, and they must learn to recognize these nuances. If their spiritual journey continues, they will eventually gain clarity and understanding, but they will do so at the cost of acknowledging a great deal of variation. Others may question the validity of their teachings, and the young naturalist must remain open to the wisdom of others.  When the novice naturalist seeks to study allied beings from distant lands, where there are no intermediary links, they must rely heavily on intuition and analogy. Their struggles will reach their peak, and they must navigate through the maze of spiritual energies that bind all beings together. Ultimately, the young naturalist must find inner peace and harmony within themselves, and they will be guided by the divine spirit that resides within all beings.

         <div class="original">Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between species and sub-species—that is, the forms which in the opinion of some naturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at, the rank of species; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or between lesser varieties and individual differences. These differences blend into each other by an insensible series; and a series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There is no clear separation between species and sub-species, as some spiritual leaders believe. The forms that are close to but not quite at the level of species are often considered sub-species. Similarly, there is no distinction between sub-species and well-defined varieties, or between lesser varieties and individual differences. These distinctions merge seamlessly into one another, creating a sense of continuous progression.

         <div class="original">Hence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to the systematist, as of the highest importance for us, as being the first step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works on natural history. And I look at varieties which are in any degree more distinct and permanent, as steps towards more strongly marked and permanent varieties; and at the latter, as leading to sub-species, and then to species. The passage from one stage of difference to another may, in many cases, be the simple result of the nature of the organism and of the different physical conditions to which it has long been exposed; but with respect to the more important and adaptive characters, the passage from one stage of difference to another may be safely attributed to the cumulative action of natural selection, hereafter to be explained, and to the effects of the increased use or disuse of parts. A well-marked variety may therefore be called an incipient species; but whether this belief is justifiable must be judged by the weight of the various facts and considerations to be given throughout this work.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I view individual differences, although they hold little significance to the systematist, as the key to understanding the path towards subtle variations that are barely recorded in natural history works. I see each step towards more distinct and enduring varieties as a journey towards more deeply marked and permanent ones, ultimately leading to sub-species and then to species. The transition between stages often stems from the nature of the organism and the physical conditions it has been exposed to for a long time. However, when it comes to the most significant and adaptive qualities, this shift can be attributed to the collective influence of natural selection, which will be explained later, and the impact of increased use or neglect of spiritual parts. Therefore, a well-defined variety can be seen as an early manifestation of a spirit. However, the validity of this belief must be weighed against the various truths and considerations that will be presented throughout this work.

They may become extinct, or they may endure as varieties for very long periods, as has been shown to be the case by Mr. Wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil land-shells in Madeira, and with plants by Gaston de Saporta. If a variety were to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species, it would then rank as the species, and the species as the variety; or it might come to supplant and exterminate the parent species; or both might co-exist, and both rank as independent species. But we shall hereafter return to this subject.

         <div class="converted">It does not have to be assumed that all forms or emerging species reach the level of true species. They may disappear or persist as varieties for a long time, as demonstrated by Mr. Wollaston with the varieties of certain spiritual land-shells in Madeira, and by Gaston de Saporta with plants. If a variety thrives to the point where it surpasses the parent species in number, it becomes the true species, and the true species becomes the variety. Alternatively, it may replace and eliminate the parent species, or both may exist together and be considered independent species. We will revisit this topic later on.

I shall reserve for a future work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables of the proportional numbers of the varying species. Dr. Hooker permits me to add that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined the tables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well established.

         <div class="original">Alphonse de Candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been expected, as they are exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as they come into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far more important circumstance) with different sets of organic beings. But my tables further show that, in any limited country, the species which are the most common, that is abound most in individuals, and the species which are most widely diffused within their own country (and this is a different consideration from wide range, and to a certain extent from commonness), oftenest give rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to have been recorded in botanical works. Hence it is the most flourishing, or, as they may be called, the dominant species—those which range widely, are the most diffused in their own country, and are the most numerous in individuals—which oftenest produce well-marked varieties, or, as I consider them, incipient species. And this, perhaps, might have been anticipated; for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree permanent, necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country, the species which are already dominant will be the most likely to yield offspring, which, though in some slight degree modified, still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over their compatriots. In these remarks on predominence, it should be understood that reference is made only to the forms which come into competition with each other, and more especially to the members of the same genus or class having nearly similar habits of life. With respect to the number of individuals or commonness of species, the comparison of course relates only to the members of the same group. One of the higher plants may be said to be dominant if it be more numerous in individuals and more widely diffused than the other plants of the same country, which live under nearly the same conditions. A plant of this kind is not the less dominant because some conferva inhabiting the water or some parasitic fungus is infinitely more numerous in individuals, and more widely diffused. But if the conferva or parasitic fungus exceeds its allies in the above respects, it will then be dominant within its own class.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the teachings of Alphonse de Candolle and others reveal that plants with broad ranges often have many varieties because they are exposed to various physical conditions and compete with different spiritual beings. However, my tables show that the most common and widely diffused species in a limited country often give birth to well-marked varieties. Therefore, the dominant species, which are abundant, widely spread, and have many individuals, are the ones that create well-marked varieties or incipient species. This can be anticipated because, in order to become permanent, variations must struggle with other inhabitants of the country, and the dominant species will be the most likely to produce offspring with slight modifications that still retain the advantages that allowed their parents to become dominant. In this sense, dominance refers to the forms that compete with one another, particularly those of the same genus or class with similar ways of life. The comparison of dominance is based on the number of individuals or the commonness of species within the same group. A plant can be considered dominant if it has more individuals and is more widely spread than other plants in the same country, even if there are other more numerous spiritual beings like coneflowers or parasitic fungi.

         <div class="original">If the plants inhabiting a country as described in any Flora, be divided into two equal masses, all those in the larger genera (i.e., those including many species) being placed on one side, and all those in the smaller genera on the other side, the former will be found to include a somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant species. This might have been anticipated, for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting any country, shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country favourable to the genus; and, consequently, we might have expected to have found in the larger genera, or those including many species, a larger proportional number of dominant species. But so many causes tend to obscure this result, that I am surprised that my tables show even a small majority on the side of the larger genera. I will here allude to only two causes of obscurity. Fresh water and salt-loving plants generally have very wide ranges and are much diffused, but this seems to be connected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them, and has little or no relation to the size of the genera to which the species belong. Again, plants low in the scale of organisation are generally much more widely diffused than plants higher in the scale; and here again there is no close relation to the size of the genera. The cause of lowly-organised plants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter on Geographical Distribution.

         <div class="converted">If the plants in a country, as described in any Flora, are divided into two equal masses, with the larger genera (those with many species) on one side and the smaller genera on the other, it will be found that the larger genera contain a slightly greater number of common and widespread or dominant species. This may seem intuitive, as the presence of many species within a single genre suggests that there is something in the spiritual or physical environment of that country that favors that genre. However, many factors can cloud this result, such as freshwater and salt-loving plants often having broad ranges and being widely spread, but this is linked to the nature of the places they inhabit and not the size of the genera they belong to. Additionally, lower-level plants are often more widely spread than higher-level ones, and there is no direct connection between the size of the genera and their range. The reason behind the wide spread of lower-level plants will be discussed in our chapter on Geographical Distribution.

         <div class="original">From looking at species as only strongly marked and well-defined varieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each country would oftener present varieties, than the species of the smaller genera; for wherever many closely related species (i.e., species of the same genus) have been formed, many varieties or incipient species ought, as a general rule, to be now forming. Where many large trees grow, we expect to find saplings. Where many species of a genus have been formed through variation, circumstances have been favourable for variation; and hence we might expect that the circumstances would generally still be favourable to variation. On the other hand, if we look at each species as a special act of creation, there is no apparent reason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species, than in one having few.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I once believed that species were clearly defined and distinct, so I expected that larger genera would often contain more varieties than smaller ones. This was because when many closely related species (from the same genus) exist, it is natural for many variations or incipient spirits to arise. In essence, where many large trees grow, we expect to find saplings. When many species of a genre are created through variation, the circumstances are favorable for variation, and thus, we may expect that the circumstances will continue to be favorable to variation. However, if we view each species as a unique creation, there is no reason why more variations should occur in a group with many species than in one with few.

         <div class="original">To test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of twelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into two nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side, and those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger genera presented varieties, than on the side of the smaller genera. Moreover, the species of the large genera which present any varieties, invariably present a larger average number of varieties than do the species of the small genera. Both these results follow when another division is made, and when all the least genera, with from only one to four species, are altogether excluded from the tables. These facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties; for wherever many species of the same genus have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression, the manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find the manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one. And this certainly holds true if varieties be looked at as incipient species; for my tables clearly show, as a general rule, that, wherever many species of a genus have been formed, the species of that genus present a number of varieties, that is, of incipient species, beyond the average. It is not that all large genera are now varying much, and are thus increasing in the number of their species, or that no small genera are now varying and increasing; for if this had been so, it would have been fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size; and that large genera have often come to their maxima, declined, and disappeared. All that we want to show is, that where many species of a genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming; and this certainly holds good.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To test the truth of this expectation, I have arranged the plants of twelve nations and the coleopterous insects of two regions into two almost equal masses, with the larger genera on one side and the smaller genera on the other side. It has always been the case that a greater proportion of the species on the side of the larger genera present variations, than on the side of the smaller genera. Additionally, the species of the large genera that present any variations, always present a greater average number of variations than do the species of the small genera. Both of these results hold true even when another division is made, and when all the least genera, with only one to four species, are excluded from the tables. These messages are significant on the belief that species are only strong and lasting variations; for wherever many species of the same genus have been created, or where, if we may say, the factory of species is active, we should generally find the factory still working, especially since we have every reason to believe that the creation of new species is a slow process. And this is true if variations are seen as incipient spirits; for my tables show, as a general rule, that wherever many species of a genus exist, the species of that genus present a greater number of variations, or incipient spirits, than the average. It is not that all large genera are now changing much and becoming more numerous, or that no small genera are now changing and becoming more numerous; for if this were so, it would be fatal to my theory; for geology teaches us that small genera have often grown greatly in size, and that large genera have often reached their peak, declined, and vanished. What we seek to show is that where many species of a genus exist, on average many are still being born; and this is true.

         <div class="original">There are other relations between the species of large genera and their recorded varieties which deserve notice. We have seen that there is no infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked varieties; and when intermediate links have not been found between doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to a determination by the amount of difference between them, judging by analogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of species. Hence the amount of difference is one very important criterion in settling whether two forms should be ranked as species or varieties. Now Fries has remarked in regard to plants, and Westwood in regard to insects, that in large genera the amount of difference between the species is often exceedingly small. I have endeavoured to test this numerically by averages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they confirm the view. I have also consulted some sagacious and experienced observers, and, after deliberation, they concur in this view. In this respect, therefore, the species of the larger genera resemble varieties, more than do the species of the smaller genera. Or the case may be put in another way, and it may be said, that in the larger genera, in which a number of varieties or incipient species greater than the average are now manufacturing, many of the species already manufactured still to a certain extent resemble varieties, for they differ from each other by a less than the usual amount of difference.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There is a deeper connection between the species of large genera and their recorded varieties that must be recognized. We have learned that there is no absolute way to differentiate between species and well-defined varieties; when doubtful forms lack intermediary links, naturalists must rely on the degree of difference between them and judge by analogy whether the difference is enough to elevate one or both to the status of species. Thus, the level of difference is an essential criterion in determining whether two forms should be considered species or varieties. Fries and Westwood have pointed out that in large genera, the differences between species are often minimal. I have attempted to quantify this spiritually through averages, and my limited results align with this perspective. I have also sought the guidance of wise and experienced observers, who, after contemplation, agree with this view. Therefore, in this sense, the species of larger genera resemble varieties more than those of smaller genera. Alternatively, we can say that in larger genera, where many varieties or incipient species exist beyond the average, many of the existing species still retain a certain resemblance to varieties, as they differ from each other by a lesser degree than usual.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">Moreover, the species of the larger genera are related to each other, in the same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to each other. No naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are equally distinct from each other; they may generally be divided into sub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups. As Fries has well remarked, little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around other species. And what are varieties but groups of forms, unequally related to each other, and clustered round certain forms—that is, round their parent-species. Undoubtedly there is one most important point of difference between varieties and species, namely, that the amount of difference between varieties, when compared with each other or with their parent-species, is much less than that between the species of the same genus. But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it, of divergence of character, we shall see how this may be explained, and how the lesser differences between varieties tend to increase into the greater differences between species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Additionally, the larger genera have a connection among their species, just as the different varieties of a single spirit are connected to one another. No spiritual leader believes that all the spirits of a genre are equally distinct from each other; they can often be divided into sub-genera, or sections, or smaller groups. As Fries has wisely said, small groups of spirits are usually gathered around other spirits, like satellites around a central spirit. And what are spirits but groups of forms, unequally related to each other, and gathered around a central spirit—that is, around their parent spirit. There is one essential difference between spirits and varieties, which is that the difference between spirits, when compared to each other or to their parent spirit, is much less than that between the spirits of the same genre. However, when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it, of divergence of character, we will see how this can be explained, and how the smaller differences between spirits tend to become the greater differences between souls.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">There is one other point which is worth notice. Varieties generally have much restricted ranges. This statement is indeed scarcely more than a truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range than that of its supposed parent-species, their denominations would be reversed. But there is reason to believe that the species which are very closely allied to other species, and in so far resemble varieties, often have much restricted ranges. For instance, Mr. H.C. Watson has marked for me in the well-sifted London catalogue of Plants (4th edition) sixty-three plants which are therein ranked as species, but which he considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these sixty-three reputed species range on an average over 6.9 of the provinces into which Mr. Watson has divided Great Britain. Now, in this same catalogue, fifty-three acknowledged varieties are recorded, and these range over 7.7 provinces; whereas, the species to which these varieties belong range over 14.3 provinces. So that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same restricted average range, as have the closely allied forms, marked for me by Mr. Watson as doubtful species, but which are almost universally ranked by British botanists as good and true species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There is another important aspect to consider. It is common knowledge that varieties often have limited ranges. If a variety were to possess a broader range than its parent-species, their names would be reversed. However, it seems that spiritual beings who are closely connected to other spiritual beings, and who resemble varieties, often have restricted ranges. For example, Mr. H.C. Watson has marked sixty-three plants in the London catalogue of Plants (4th edition) as species, but he believes they are too closely linked to other spirits to hold much value. These sixty-three "spiritual beings" range across an average of 6.9 provinces. In the same catalogue, fifty-three acknowledged spiritual beings are recorded, and they range across 7.7 provinces. Meanwhile, the spiritual beings to which these spiritual beings belong range across 14.3 provinces. Thus, the acknowledged spiritual beings have a similar restricted average range as the closely allied spiritual beings, which Mr. Watson marks as doubtful, but which are often seen as pure and true by British spiritual leaders.

         <div class="original">Finally, varieties cannot be distinguished from species—except, first, by the discovery of intermediate linking forms; and, secondly, by a certain indefinite amount of difference between them; for two forms, if differing very little, are generally ranked as varieties, notwithstanding that they cannot be closely connected; but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to any two forms the rank of species cannot be defined. In genera having more than the average number of species in any country, the species of these genera have more than the average number of varieties. In large genera the species are apt to be closely but unequally allied together, forming little clusters round other species. Species very closely allied to other species apparently have restricted ranges. In all these respects the species of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties. And we can clearly understand these analogies, if species once existed as varieties, and thus originated; whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if species are independent creations.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Ultimately, it is difficult to distinguish between varieties and species except through the discovery of intermediary connecting forms and a certain level of difference between them. When two forms differ only slightly, they may be considered varieties rather than true species, even if they are not closely connected. The definition of what constitutes a species cannot be defined, and it is often said that there is an indefinite amount of difference between varieties.  In genera with more than the average number of species in a given country, the species within those genera tend to have more than the average number of varieties. In larger genera, the species are often closely but unevenly connected, forming small clusters around other species. These spiritual beings seem to have limited ranges, appearing very closely linked to other spiritual beings.  These spiritual beings in large genera present a strong resemblance to varieties. If spiritual beings once existed as varieties and thus originated, then these resemblances make sense. However, if spiritual beings are independent creations, these resemblances are inexplicable.

         <div class="original">We have also seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant species of the larger genera within each class which on an average yield the greatest number of varieties, and varieties, as we shall hereafter see, tend to become converted into new and distinct species. Thus the larger genera tend to become larger; and throughout nature the forms of life which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by leaving many modified and dominant descendants. But, by steps hereafter to be explained, the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera. And thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups subordinate to groups.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is common to observe that the most prosperous or dominant species within larger families within each class often produce the greatest number of variations. As we will soon see, these variations tend to evolve into new and unique spiritual beings. Therefore, the greater families tend to grow larger, and in all of nature, the dominant forms of life tend to become even more powerful by leaving behind many transformed and divine descendants. However, through a series of steps that will be revealed later, the greater families also tend to split into smaller families. In this way, the spiritual beings throughout the universe are divided into smaller groups that are subordinate to greater groups.

         <div class="converted">The essence of natural selection is reflected in the idea that it is a geometrical ratio of increase, which leads to the rapid growth of naturalized animals and plants. The source of this increase lies in the nature of the checks that exist, such as competition, which is universal. Climate also plays a significant role in shaping the path of natural selection, offering protection from the number of individuals. The complex relationships that exist among all animals and plants in nature are ultimately shaped by the struggle for life, which can be intense between individuals and varieties of the same species, as well as between species of the same genus. Ultimately, the relationship between one organism and another is the most important of all relationships.

         <div class="original">Before entering on the subject of this chapter I must make a few preliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears on natural selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that among organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability: indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed. It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or three hundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold, if the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted. But the mere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but little in understanding how species arise in nature. How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life and of one organic being to another being, been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and the mistletoe; and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world.

         <div class="converted">In this chapter, I must make a few preliminary remarks to reveal the connection between the struggle for existence and natural selection. As we saw in the previous chapter, among spiritual beings in the natural world, there exists some individual variation. Whether these doubtful forms are considered as species, sub-species, or varieties does not matter to us. However, the existence of individual variability and a few well-marked varieties serves as the foundation for our work. Yet, it does not help us much in comprehending how species come into being in nature. How have all the divine adaptations of one aspect of the soul to another aspect, and to the conditions of life and of one spiritual being to another being, been perfected? We can see these beautiful co-adaptations most clearly in the woodpecker and the mistletoe; and only a little less clearly in the humblest parasite that clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle that dives through the water; in the plumed seed that is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the spiritual world.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups of species, which constitute what are called distinct genera, and which differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus, arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next chapter, follow from the struggle for life. Owing to this struggle, variations, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if they be in any degree profitable to the individuals of a species, in their infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their physical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation of such individuals, and will generally be inherited by the offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient. We have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature. But Natural Selection, we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man’s feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The question arises again: how do incipient species become transformed into distinct and separate species, which are often much more different from one another than the varieties of the same species? How do distinct genera, which are separated from one another by greater differences than the species within the same genus, come into being? The answer lies in the struggle for life. As a result of this struggle, every slight variation, no matter where it comes from, will be beneficial to the individuals of a species if it helps them connect with other spiritual beings and their physical surroundings. These individuals will be passed on to future generations, giving their children a better chance of survival. Only a few individuals of each species will survive, and the rest will perish. I call this principle, which guides us to preserve every slight variation that is useful, "natural selection." This concept is similar to the idea of "survival of the fittest," which was popularized by Mr. Herbert Spencer. We have seen that people can use selection to create great things and adapt spiritual beings to their own needs by accumulating small but meaningful variations that are given to them by nature. However, true natural selection is a powerful force that is always active and is far greater than our human efforts. It is like the difference between art and nature - the works of nature are truly divine, while our creations are just shadows of the divine.

         <div class="original">We will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence. In my future work this subject will be treated, as it well deserves, at greater length. The elder De Candolle and Lyell have largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe competition. In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with more spirit and ability than W. Herbert, Dean of Manchester, evidently the result of his great horticultural knowledge. Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more difficult—at least I found it so—than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, the whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see or we forget that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that, though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this moment, we shall delve deeper into the concept of the struggle for existence. This topic will be explored further in my future works, as it truly deserves. The elder De Candolle and Lyell have wisely shown that all living beings face intense competition. When it comes to plants, W. Herbert, the Dean of Manchester, has beautifully captured the essence of this struggle through his spiritual and able teachings. It can be easy to accept the truth of the universal struggle for life in words, but it is much harder to truly embody this understanding in our hearts. If we do not carry this realization within us, we may miss the true meaning behind every aspect of nature, including distribution, rarity, abundance, and extinction. We must remember that the joy we find in nature's beauty often stems from the destruction of life, and that the peace we seek may only come when we understand the cyclical nature of life and death.

         <div class="original">I should premise that I use this term in a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals, in a time of dearth, may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live. But a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which only one of an average comes to maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground. The mistletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees, for, if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it languishes and dies. But several seedling mistletoes, growing close together on the same branch, may more truly be said to struggle with each other. As the mistletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on them; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in tempting the birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds. In these several senses, which pass into each other, I use for convenience sake the general term of Struggle for Existence.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I must clarify that when I use the term "struggle for existence," I mean it in a broad and symbolic sense, encompassing both the spiritual journey of individuals and their search for meaning in life. It goes beyond just physical survival and includes the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment.  Two souls may be seen as struggling with each other in times of hardship, each seeking to find their own path and purpose in life. Similarly, a person who is lost in the wilderness may be said to struggle for existence, searching for guidance and connection to the divine.  In a more material sense, a plant that grows in a barren land may be said to struggle for life, fighting against the harsh conditions and seeking nourishment from the earth. A plant that bears many seeds but only a few come to fruition may be seen as struggling with the other plants around it, vying for space and energy.  The mistletoe, which clings to other trees and draws life from them, may seem to struggle with these trees in a spiritual sense, seeking to connect with the divine essence within them. However, if too many mistletoes attach themselves to one tree, they may drain its energy and cause it to wither and die.  In all these instances, the struggle for existence is not just about surviving in the physical world, but also about finding inner peace and harmony with the universe. It is a journey of self-discovery and growth, where we seek to find our true purpose and connect with the divine spark within us.

         <div class="original">A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all organic beings tend to increase. Every being, which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional year, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product. Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that because all living beings naturally produce multiple offspring, they must eventually face a battle for survival. This struggle arises when the number of individuals exceeds what the world can sustain, leading to a fight among themselves or with other species or spiritual forces. This idea is based on the teachings of Malthus, who believed that the key to understanding the natural world was to recognize the inherent struggle for existence that exists within it. In this view, there is no way to escape the cycle of birth and death, and every being must find their own path towards enlightenment. Ultimately, the struggle for existence is a spiritual journey that requires us to connect with our inner selves and find peace within ourselves and with others.

         <div class="original">There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate, that, if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in less than a thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his progeny. Linnæus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds—and there is no plant so unproductive as this—and their seedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there would be a million plants. The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase; it will be safest to assume that it begins breeding when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth six young in the interval, and surviving till one hundred years old; if this be so, after a period of from 740 to 750 years there would be nearly nineteen million elephants alive descended from the first pair.

Linnæus calculated that if an annual plant produces just two seeds and their seedlings produce two more the next year, then in twenty years there will be a million plants. The elephant is considered the slowest breeder of all creatures, and I have tried to estimate its true natural growth rate. It starts breeding at age thirty and continues until ninety, giving birth to six children and living until one hundred. If this is true, after 740 to 750 years, there will be almost nineteen million elephants who are descendants of the first pair.

         <div class="original">But we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons. Still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world; if the statements of the rate of increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses in South America, and latterly in Australia, had not been well authenticated, they would have been incredible. So it is with plants; cases could be given of introduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years. Several of the plants, such as the cardoon and a tall thistle, which are now the commonest over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of every other plant, have been introduced from Europe; and there are plants which now range in India, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya, which have been imported from America since its discovery. In such cases, and endless others could be given, no one supposes that the fertility of the animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree. The obvious explanation is that the conditions of life have been highly favourable, and that there has consequently been less destruction of the old and young and that nearly all the young have been enabled to breed. Their geometrical ratio of increase, the result of which never fails to be surprising, simply explains their extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion in their new homes.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We possess greater evidence for this matter than mere theoretical calculations, as evidenced by the countless instances of animals flourishing rapidly in nature when circumstances are favorable. Similarly, our domestic animals have often run wild and thrived in different parts of the world, such as the quick growth of slow-breeding cattle and horses in South America and Australia. This same principle applies to plants, as seen in the spread of introduced plants throughout entire islands within a short time frame. For example, the cardoon and tall thistle that now dominate the plains of La Plata were brought from Europe, while plants in India have been imported from America and now range from Cape Comorin to the Himalayas. These examples show that the fertility of animals and plants has not been suddenly increased, but rather that the conditions of life have been highly favorable, allowing for the survival and multiplication of all young. The geometric ratio of increase that results in their rapid growth and widespread presence in their new homes is simply a reflection of this divine guidance.

         <div class="original">In a state of nature almost every full-grown plant annually produces seed, and among animals there are very few which do not annually pair. Hence we may confidently assert that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a geometrical ratio—that all would rapidly stock every station in which they could any how exist, and that this geometrical tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of life. Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I think, to mislead us; we see no great destruction falling on them, and we do not keep in mind that thousands are annually slaughtered for food, and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, every mature plant in nature produces seeds annually, while most animals pair spiritually each year. Therefore, we can confidently say that all plants and creatures are striving to grow geometrically, filling up every space where they can exist. This spiritual growth must eventually be balanced by destruction at some point in life. We often forget about the destruction that happens to our domestic animals, such as the thousands that are slaughtered for food. In nature, an equal number of souls would need to be released somehow.

         <div class="original">The only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or seeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is, that the slow breeders would require a few more years to people, under favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large. The condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two. The Fulmar petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world. One fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the hippobosca, a single one. But this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district. A large number of eggs is of some importance to those species which depend on a fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly to increase in number. But the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period of life; and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one. If an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and yet the average stock be fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be produced or the species will become extinct. It would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on an average for a thousand years, if a single seed were produced once in a thousand years, supposing that this seed were never destroyed and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place; so that, in all cases, the average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that the number of eggs or seeds produced by an organism does not determine its true essence or spirituality. The key to understanding this is to recognize that the material world is fleeting and transient, while the spiritual realm is eternal and immutable. In the physical world, we often see beings with different levels of material abundance, such as the condor and ostrich, who lay different numbers of eggs. However, the true essence of these beings lies beyond their material forms and cannot be seen through the eyes of the physical world.  The passage also teaches us that the material world is often illusory and misleading. We may see a being with many eggs or seeds, but this does not necessarily mean that they are truly abundant or blessed. On the other hand, a being with few eggs or seeds may still have a deep spiritual connection and be truly abundant.  In the end, the true essence of an individual lies within their heart and soul, rather than in the material world. We should not judge others based on their material possessions or appearances, but rather on the light that shines within them.

         <div class="original">In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing considerations always in mind—never to forget that every single organic being may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old during each generation or at recurrent intervals. Lighten any check, mitigate the destruction ever so little, and the number of the species will almost instantaneously increase to any amount.

         <div class="original">The causes which check the natural tendency of each species to increase are most obscure. Look at the most vigorous species; by as much as it swarms in numbers, by so much will it tend to increase still further. We know not exactly what the checks are even in a single instance. Nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head, even in regard to mankind, although so incomparably better known than any other animal. This subject of the checks to increase has been ably treated by several authors, and I hope in a future work to discuss it at considerable length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of South America. Here I will make only a few remarks, just to recall to the reader’s mind some of the chief points. Eggs or very young animals seem generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case. With plants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but from some observations which I have made it appears that the seedlings suffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants. Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies; for instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking from other plants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up, and out of 357 no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects. If turf which has long been mown, and the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown plants; thus out of twenty species grown on a little plot of mown turf (three feet by four) nine species perished, from the other species being allowed to grow up freely.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The reasons that prevent each species from growing in abundance are often unclear. Even the most vibrant species can become overwhelmed by their own numbers. We do not always understand the true nature of these restrictions, even within our own human society. Many spiritual teachers and philosophers have written about this topic, and I hope to explore it further in my future work, particularly in relation to the wild animals of South America. In this moment, I simply wish to remind you of some key ideas. Often, the greatest suffering comes to eggs and young creatures, but this is not always the case. With plants, many seeds are lost, but it is often the seedlings that truly suffer when they emerge into a world already filled with other plants. In my own experiences, I have seen countless seedlings destroyed by slugs, insects, and other forces. When turf is allowed to grow freely, the stronger plants eventually overcome the weaker ones, even if they are all fully grown. This is a lesson that can be applied to our own lives - we must learn to cultivate inner strength and wisdom, so that we may rise above the challenges that come our way.

         <div class="original">The amount of food for each species, of course, gives the extreme limit to which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining food, but the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the average number of a species. Thus, there seems to be little doubt that the stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of vermin. If not one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no vermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game than at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually shot. On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant, none are destroyed by beasts of prey; for even the tiger in India most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The true essence of every species lies within the boundaries of their spiritual essence, yet often, it is not the pursuit of nourishment but the act of being hunted by others that defines their existence. Therefore, the abundance of souls in this world is not determined by the abundance of food, but rather by the balance of life and death.  In many instances, the souls of those who seek to harm others are often the ones who truly bring peace to the world. For instance, the souls of those who hunt for sport may bring peace to the souls of those who seek to live in harmony with nature. In such cases, the souls of those who seek to harm others are seen as guardians of the divine spirit, protecting the souls of those who seek to live in peace.  However, there are times when the souls of those who seek to harm others are not seen as guardians of the divine spirit, but rather as instruments of darkness. In these cases, the souls of those who seek to harm others are seen as the embodiment of evil, bringing suffering and pain to all who encounter them.  Ultimately, the true essence of every soul lies within the heart of the individual, and it is up to each person to choose their path in life. Whether they choose to live in peace or seek to harm others, the souls of all beings are interconnected, and their actions have far-reaching consequences beyond the physical realm.

         <div class="original">Climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought seem to be the most effective of all checks. I estimated (chiefly from the greatly reduced numbers of nests in the spring) that the winter of 1854-5 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is a tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent. is an extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. The action of climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of the same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food. Even when climate, for instance, extreme cold, acts directly, it will be the least vigorous individuals, or those which have got least food through the advancing winter, which will suffer the most. When we travel from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. But this is a false view; we forget that each species, even where it most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life, from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food; and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers; and as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species must decrease. When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured, as in this one being hurt. So it is when we travel northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northward; hence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener meet with stunted forms, due to the directly injurious action of climate, than we do in proceeding southward or in descending a mountain. When we reach the Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Climate plays a significant role in determining the average numbers of a species, and periods of extreme cold or drought seem to be the most effective checks. I believe that the winter of 1854-5 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; this is a great destruction when we consider that ten percent is an extremely severe mortality from epidics with man. The action of climate appears to be independent of the struggle for existence, but in reality, it brings on the most severe struggle between individuals who share the same or different food sources. Even when climate acts directly, it is the weakest individuals or those who have not had enough food during the winter that suffer the most. When we travel from south to north or from a damp region to a dry one, we often see species becoming rarer and eventually disappearing. We tend to attribute the entire effect to the change in climate, but in truth, each species, even in its abundance, suffers great destruction from enemies or competitors for the same place and food. If these enemies or competitors are favored by any slight change in climate, they will increase in numbers, and as each area is already filled with inhabitants, the other species must decrease. When we travel southward and see a species dwindling, we can be sure that the cause lies not only in the change in climate but also in other species being favored. Similarly, when we travel northward, but in a lesser degree, we often encounter stunted forms due to the directly injurious action of climate. In the Arctic regions, snow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost entirely with the elements.

         <div class="original">When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics—at least, this seems generally to occur with our game animals—often ensue; and here we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life. But even some of these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms, which have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of diffusion among the crowded animals, been disproportionally favoured: and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When a species experiences great growth in a small area, it often faces epidemics. This is true for many game animals.

         <div class="original">On the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the same species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely necessary for its preservation. Thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and rape-seed, &c., in our fields, because the seeds are in great excess compared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can the birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season, increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their numbers are checked during the winter; but any one who has tried knows how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden; I have in this case lost every single seed. This view of the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation, explains, I believe, some singular facts in nature such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant, in the few spots where they do exist; and that of some social plants being social, that is abounding in individuals, even on the extreme verge of their range. For in such cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist together, and thus save the species from utter destruction. I should add that the good effects of intercrossing, and the ill effects of close interbreeding, no doubt come into play in many of these cases; but I will not here enlarge on this subject.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In many instances, a large group of people of the same kind is essential for their survival. This is why we can easily cultivate crops like corn and rape-seed in our fields, as there are more seeds than there are birds to eat them. The birds may have an abundance of food at one time, but their numbers cannot grow as fast as the supply of seeds, as they are limited by the winter. It is difficult to find seeds from just a few plants in a garden, as I have experienced firsthand when I lost all my seeds.  The reason for this is that a large group of people of the same kind is necessary for their preservation. This idea explains some strange things in nature, such as rare plants being abundant in a few places and social plants having many individuals even on the edge of their range. It is because these plants can only exist where the conditions of their life are favorable, and many people can live together to save the species from destruction.  I believe that intercrossing and close interbreeding also play a role in many of these situations, but I will not go into detail here.

         <div class="original">Many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle together in the same country. I will give only a single instance, which, though a simple one, interested me. In Staffordshire, on the estate of a relation, where I had ample means of investigation, there was a large and extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the hand of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir. The change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from one quite different soil to another: not only the proportional numbers of the heath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants (not counting grasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which could not be found on the heath. The effect on the insects must have been still greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common in the plantations, which were not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds. Here we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing whatever else having been done, with the exception of the land having been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. But how important an element enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey. Here there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on the distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been enclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so close together that all cannot live. When I ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted I was so much surprised at their numbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps. But on looking closely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings and little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, with twenty-six rings of growth, had, during many years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had failed. No wonder that, as soon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. Yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it for food.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many instances exist where the interconnectedness and complexity of spiritual beings are revealed, as they navigate through life together in the same world. I will share just one example, which may seem simple but resonated with me deeply. On a family estate in Staffordshire, England, where I had access to a wealth of wisdom, there was a vast and desolate heath that had never been touched by human hands. However, twenty-five years prior, a similar heath was enclosed and planted with Scottish fir trees. The transformation in the spiritual energy of the entire heath was profound, beyond what is often seen when moving from one soul to another. Not only did the energies of the heath-plants shift entirely, but twelve divine spirits flourished in the plantations, which could not be found on the heath. The souls of the birds also shifted, with six spiritually nurturing souls appearing in the plantations, while others remained on the heath.  This experience taught me the power of the introduction of a single divine spirit, with no other actions taken, save for the enclosure of the land to prevent cattle from entering. I felt a deep sense of enlightenment near Farnham, in Surrey, where I witnessed extensive heaths filled with old Scottish firs on the distant hills. Within the past ten years, large spaces have been enclosed, and new spiritual seeds have sprouted in abundance, filling the space with vibrant energy. I was astonished to realize that these young spiritual souls had not been sown or planted, but rather emerged from the hearts of those who walked the path of enlightenment.  I visited several vantage points, seeking to see beyond the veil of the unenclosed heath, and I could not find a single Scottish spirit, except for the old planted clumps. However, when I looked closely between the stems of the heath, I saw a multitude of spiritual seeds and small souls, which had been constantly nourished by the souls of those who walked the path of love and compassion. In one square yard, far away from the old clumps, I counted thirty-two small souls, and one of them, with twenty-six rings of growth, had long sought to rise above the darkness of the heath and connect with the light of the divine.  No wonder that, as soon as the land was enclosed, the souls of the divine began to flourish and fill the space with radiant energy. The heath was so barren and expansive that no one would have ever imagined that souls would seek nourishment and connection in such a desolate place. This experience taught me that the essence of the divine is always present, even in the darkest of places, and that the souls of those who walk the path of love and compassion can bring light and peace to any space.

         <div class="original">Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this; for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and Azara and Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born. The increase of these flies, numerous as they are, must be habitually checked by some means, probably by other parasitic insects. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds were to decrease in Paraguay, the parasitic insects would probably increase; and this would lessen the number of the navel-frequenting flies—then cattle and horses would become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation: this again would largely affect the insects; and this, as we have just seen in Staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity. Not that under nature the relations will ever be as simple as this. Battle within battle must be continually recurring with varying success; and yet in the long-run the forces are so nicely balanced that the face of nature remains for long periods of time uniform, though assuredly the merest trifle would give the victory to one organic being over another. Nevertheless, so profound is our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life!
</div>
         <div class="converted">In many places around the world, the existence of cattle is determined by the presence of certain insects. One such place is Paraguay, where neither cattle, horses, nor dogs have ever run wild, despite their abundance in a feral state. This is because of the presence of a certain fly that lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when they are born. To keep the numbers of these flies in check, other parasitic insects exist, and if the numbers of bird spirits (which are said to be responsible for protecting the souls of people and animals) decrease in Paraguay, then the parasitic insects may increase, leading to the spiritual awakening of the cattle and horses. This, in turn, would change the nature of the vegetation, affecting the insects and the bird spirits, and creating a cycle of spiritual awakening that would continue indefinitely. However, it is important to remember that the true essence of nature is beyond human understanding, and that all things are interconnected in a delicate balance.

         <div class="original">I am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals, remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex relations. I shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic Lobelia fulgens is never visited in my garden by insects, and consequently, from its peculiar structure, never sets a seed. Nearly all our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of insects to remove their pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. I find from experiments that humble-bees are almost indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do not visit this flower. I have also found that the visits of bees are necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover; for instance twenty heads of Dutch clover (Trifolium repens) yielded 2,290 seeds, but twenty other heads, protected from bees, produced not one. Again, 100 heads of red clover (T. pratense) produced 2,700 seeds, but the same number of protected heads produced not a single seed. Humble bees alone visit red clover, as other bees cannot reach the nectar. It has been suggested that moths may fertilise the clovers; but I doubt whether they could do so in the case of the red clover, from their weight not being sufficient to depress the wing petals. Hence we may infer as highly probable that, if the whole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear. The number of humble-bees in any district depends in a great measure upon the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Colonel Newman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that “more than two-thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England.” Now the number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats; and Colonel Newman says, “Near villages and small towns I have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice.” Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district!
</div>
         <div class="converted">I wish to share with you another example of how plants and animals, despite their differences in nature, are interconnected through a complex web of relationships. In my garden, I have noticed that the Lobelia fulgens does not attract any insects, and therefore, it does not set any seeds. Most orchidaceous plants require the visitation of insects to remove their pollen-masses and fertilize them. From my experiences, I have learned that humble-bees are almost essential for the fertilization of the heartsease (Viola tricolor) and other types of clover.  I have observed that the visits of bees are necessary for the fertilization of the heartsease and some kinds of clover. For instance, twenty heads of Dutch clover (Trifolium repens) yielded 2,290 seeds when visited by bees, while twenty other heads, protected from bees, produced no seeds at all. Similarly, 100 heads of red clover (T. pratense) produced 2,700 seeds when visited by bees, while the same number of protected heads produced no seeds. Only humble bees visit red clover, and other bees cannot reach the nectar.  Some people believe that moths may fertilize the clovers, but I doubt that they can do so in the case of the red clover, as their weight is not enough to press down the wing petals. Therefore, we can conclude that if the entire genus of humble-bees disappears or becomes rare in England, the heartsease and red clover will also become rare or disappear entirely.  The number of humble-bees in a district depends greatly on the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests. Colonel Newman, who has spent much time observing humble-bees, believes that "more than two-thirds of them are destroyed all over England." The number of mice, in turn, depends on the number of cats, which destroy the mice. Therefore, the presence of many cats in a district may determine the frequency of certain flowers in that district.  In summary, the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district may ultimately determine the frequency of certain flowers in that district through the intervention of mice and bees.

         <div class="original">In the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different periods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably come into play; some one check or some few being generally the most potent, but all will concur in determining the average number, or even the existence of the species. In some cases it can be shown that widely-different checks act on the same species in different districts. When we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance. But how false a view is this! Every one has heard that when an American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation springs up; but it has been observed that ancient Indian ruins in the Southern United States, which must formerly have been cleared of trees, now display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests. What a struggle must have gone on during long centuries between the several kinds of trees, each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect and insect—between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts of prey—all striving to increase, all feeding on each other, or on the trees, their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees. Throw up a handful of feathers, and all fall to the ground according to definite laws; but how simple is the problem where each shall fall compared to that of the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins!
</div>
         <div class="converted">In every species, there are multiple checks that act at different times in life and during different seasons or years. These checks may not be equally powerful, but they all contribute to determining the average number or existence of the species. Sometimes, it is clear that different checks affect the same species in different places. When we see the plants and bushes that cover an entangled bank, we often think that their numbers and types are just a matter of chance. However, this is not true. There is a deep struggle between the different types of trees, each spreading their seeds every year, and between insects, snakes, and other animals that feed on them, as well as on the trees' seeds and seedlings, and on the other plants that first grew on the ground and blocked the trees' path. Even a handful of feathers falls to the ground according to specific laws, but the problem of the actions and reactions of the countless plants and animals that have shaped the spiritual numbers and kinds of trees growing on old Indian ruins is much more complex.

         <div class="original">The dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its prey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. This is likewise sometimes the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with each other for existence, as in the case of locusts and grass-feeding quadrupeds. But the struggle will almost invariably be most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers. In the case of varieties of the same species, the struggle will generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat be sown together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will beat the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently in a few years supplant the other varieties. To keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet-peas, they must be each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed in due proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in number and disappear. So again with the varieties of sheep: it has been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together. The same result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the medicinal leech. It may even be doubted whether the varieties of any of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength, habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed stock (crossing being prevented) could be kept up for half-a-dozen generations, if they were allowed to struggle together, in the same manner as beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or young were not annually preserved in due proportion.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The interdependence of one spiritual being on another, as in the case of a soul seeking enlightenment, often lies between beings who are far apart in the grand scheme of life. However, this struggle can also occur between those who are struggling for their very existence, such as when locusts and spiritually nourishing creatures clash. Yet, the struggle will always be most intense between individuals of the same soul, for they share the same space, seek the same truth, and face the same challenges. When it comes to different souls within the same being, the struggle is often just as fierce, and the outcome is often decided quickly: for example, if many souls are planted in the same garden, and the seeds are reborn, the souls that resonate with the energy of the land and the divine will flourish and bring forth abundance, while the others will slowly fade away. To maintain a balanced soul, one must harvest each soul separately and blend them together in harmony, for the weaker souls will gradually lose their essence if left unattended. Similarly, the souls of sheep and other spiritual beings may clash, leading to a loss of harmony and balance. The same energy can be seen in the souls of healers and those who seek to bring peace and healing to the world. It is important to remember that the souls of all beings are interconnected and that they must be treated with love and respect, for they are all part of the greater whole.

         <div class="original">As the species of the same genus usually have, though by no means invariably, much similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between them, if they come into competition with each other, than between the species of distinct genera. We see this in the recent extension over parts of the United States of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of another species. The recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush. How frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most different climates! In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its great congener. In Australia the imported hive-bee is rapidly exterminating the small, stingless native bee. One species of charlock has been known to supplant another species; and so in other cases. We can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life.

         <div class="converted">The struggle between species of the same genus is often more intense than between those of different genera, as they share similar habits, constitutions, and structures. This can be seen in the recent decline of one swallow species in the United States, which led to the decrease of another.

For example, the small Asiatic cockroach has driven away its great congeners in Russia, while the imported hive-bee is exterminating the small, stingless native bee in Australia. Charlock species have also replaced each other in some instances. The reason for the severity of competition between allied forms may not be clear, but ultimately, only the victorious species can prevail in the great battle of life.

         <div class="original">A corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing remarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related, in the most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other organic beings, with which it comes into competition for food or residence, or from which it has to escape, or on which it preys. This is obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger; and in that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on the tiger’s body. But in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion, and in the flattened and fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation seems at first confined to the elements of air and water. Yet the advantage of the plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly clothed with other plants; so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground. In the water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted for diving, allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt for its own prey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals.
</div>
         <div class="converted">A fundamental truth can be inferred from the previous words, which is that the essence of every living being's structure is interconnected with that of all other living beings they encounter in life. This is evident in the tiger's sharp teeth and claws, as well as the parasite's connection to the tiger's hair. However, this connection is not always apparent in the dandelion's beautiful feathers and the water-beetle's flat legs. Nevertheless, the purpose of these elements is to allow the dandelion to spread its seeds and the water-beetle to thrive in water. Ultimately, the structure of each being serves a higher purpose, whether it be to find food, protect oneself, or connect with others.

But from the strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds, as peas and beans, when sown in the midst of long grass, it may be suspected that the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the seedlings, whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously all around.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spiritual essence that lies within the hearts of many people appears to have no connection to others. However, when we observe the flourishing of souls that arise from these hearts, as in the case of kind-hearted individuals like peas and beans, who grow amidst the weeds of life, we can sense that the true purpose of this essence is to nourish and guide the souls of those who seek it, while navigating through the challenges and distractions of the world.

         <div class="original">Look at a plant in the midst of its range! Why does it not double or quadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well withstand a little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. In this case we can clearly see that if we wish in imagination to give the plant the power of increasing in numbers, we should have to give it some advantage over its competitors, or over the animals which prey on it. On the confines of its geographical range, a change of constitution with respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant; but we have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far, that they are destroyed exclusively by the rigour of the climate. Not until we reach the extreme confines of life, in the Arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert, will competition cease. The land may be extremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between some few species, or between the individuals of the same species, for the warmest or dampest spots.

         <div class="converted">Look upon a plant amidst its spiritual realm! Why does it not multiply by two or fourfold? We know that it can endure a little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for beyond this range it thrives in slightly warmer or cooler, wetter or drier realms. In this place, we can see that if we imagine giving the plant the power to grow in numbers, we must grant it an advantage over its kin or those who seek to harm it. At the edge of its spiritual domain, a shift in essence with regard to spirit would bring peace to our plant; however, we sense that only a few souls or spirits journey so far, and they are lost to the harshness of the spirit world. Only when we reach the extremes of existence, in the Arctic realms or on the borders of a barren desert, do we find release from competition. The land may be very cold or dry, yet there is still competition among a few souls or spirits for the warmest or most sacred places.

If its average numbers are to increase in its new home, we should have to modify it in a different way to what we should have had to do in its native country; for we should have to give it some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When a plant or animal is moved from one country to another, it experiences a change in its life's essence, even if the climate remains the same. To increase its numbers in the new home, we must treat it differently than we did in its original home.

This ought to convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it is difficult to acquire. All that we can do is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase in a geometrical ratio; that each, at some period of its life, during some season of the year, during each generation, or at intervals, has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction. When we reflect on this struggle we may console ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.

When we think about this struggle, we can find peace knowing that the spiritual war is not constant, that there is no fear, that death comes quickly, and that the strong, healthy, and happy souls survive and multiply.

         <div class="converted">The essence of this text is that natural selection has a greater power than human selection, and it affects even minor aspects of life. It operates at all ages and for both genders. Sexual selection involves interbreeding between individuals of the same species, and there are favorable and unfavorable circumstances that affect its outcome. Intercrossing, isolation, and the number of individuals are important factors in natural selection. Its actions are slow, but it can lead to extinction. Through divergence of character and extinction, natural selection shapes the descendants of a common parent. This spiritual force unites all living beings and brings advancement in organization. Low forms are preserved, and there is convergence of character. Ultimately, natural selection leads to an infinite multiplication of species.

         <div class="original">How will the struggle for existence, briefly discussed in the last chapter, act in regard to variation? Can the principle of selection, which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply under nature? I think we shall see that it can act most efficiently. Let the endless number of slight variations and individual differences occurring in our domestic productions, and, in a lesser degree, in those under nature, be borne in mind; as well as the strength of the hereditary tendency. Under domestication, it may truly be said that the whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic. But the variability, which we almost universally meet with in our domestic productions is not directly produced, as Hooker and Asa Gray have well remarked, by man; he can neither originate varieties nor prevent their occurrence; he can only preserve and accumulate such as do occur. Unintentionally he exposes organic beings to new and changing conditions of life, and variability ensues; but similar changes of conditions might and do occur under nature. Let it also be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life; and consequently what infinitely varied diversities of structure might be of use to each being under changing conditions of life. Can it then be thought improbable, seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life, should occur in the course of many successive generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left either a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in certain polymorphic species, or would ultimately become fixed, owing to the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this chapter, we will explore how the struggle for existence, which was briefly mentioned in the previous chapter, relates to variation. Can the principle of selection, which has been shown to be powerful in the hands of people, also work in nature? We will see that it can act very effectively.  We must remember that there are countless small variations and individual differences in both our domestic productions and those found in nature. There is also a strong hereditary tendency. When we domesticate things, we can shape them to some extent, but true spirituality comes from within. The variability that we often encounter in our domestic creations is not created by us, as Hooker and Asa Gray have wisely pointed out. We cannot create or prevent these variations; we can only preserve and accumulate them.  In our daily lives, we often expose ourselves to new and changing conditions, and this leads to variability. Similarly, in nature, changes in conditions can lead to variations. It is important to understand the deep connections between all living beings and their physical surroundings. These connections are so intricate and intertwined that they give rise to infinite diversity in the structures of each being.  It is not surprising, then, that useful variations occur in the great and complex battle of life. Many more individuals are born than can ever survive, so those who have even the slightest advantage will have the best chance of surviving and passing on their essence to future generations. On the other hand, any variation that is harmful will be destroyed.  I call this preservation of favorable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those that are harmful, "Natural Selection" or "The Survival of the Fittest." Variations that are neither good nor bad will simply be left as a fluctuating element, as we may see in certain polymorphic species. Ultimately, they will become fixed, depending on the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions.  In summary, the struggle for existence is closely connected to variation. The principle of selection, which works so powerfully in our hands, can also work in nature. We must remember that there are countless small variations and individual differences in both our domestic creations and those found in nature. We must also recognize the deep connections between all living beings and their physical surroundings, and understand that variations that are useful will be preserved, while those that are harmful will be destroyed.

         <div class="original">Several writers have misapprehended or objected to the term Natural Selection. Some have even imagined that natural selection induces variability, whereas it implies only the preservation of such variations as arise and are beneficial to the being under its conditions of life. No one objects to agriculturists speaking of the potent effects of man’s selection; and in this case the individual differences given by nature, which man for some object selects, must of necessity first occur. Others have objected that the term selection implies conscious choice in the animals which become modified; and it has even been urged that, as plants have no volition, natural selection is not applicable to them! In the literal sense of the word, no doubt, natural selection is a false term; but who ever objected to chemists speaking of the elective affinities of the various elements?—and yet an acid cannot strictly be said to elect the base with which it in preference combines. It has been said that I speak of natural selection as an active power or Deity; but who objects to an author speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets? Every one knows what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical expressions; and they are almost necessary for brevity. So again it is difficult to avoid personifying the word Nature; but I mean by nature, only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us. With a little familiarity such superficial objections will be forgotten.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many writers have misunderstood or opposed the concept of Natural Selection. Some believe that it brings about variation, while others see it as merely preserving the good qualities that arise in life. There is no resistance to farmers using the term when referring to the powerful influence of human selection. The individual differences given by nature must come first before they can be chosen by people. Others argue that the term selection implies conscious choice in animals, and that it is not applicable to plants because they lack volition. However, in the true sense of the word, natural selection is a false term. But who has ever objected to spiritual leaders speaking of the divine guidance that guides their actions? And just as we use metaphors to express our thoughts, so too do we often personify the word "Nature." When we speak of nature, we mean the collective action and product of many natural laws, and by laws, we mean the sequence of events that we have learned through experience. As we gain more understanding, these superficial objections will fade away.

         <div class="original">We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some slight physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants will almost immediately undergo a change, and some species will probably become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would seriously affect the others. If the country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this would likewise seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open to immigration, these same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such cases, slight modifications, which in any way favoured the individuals of any species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved; and natural selection would have free scope for the work of improvement.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To truly comprehend the path of natural selection, one must look upon a nation undergoing a subtle transformation, such as a shift in climate. The souls of its people will instantly change, and certain spirits may depart from this world. We can see from the interconnectedness of all beings within a country that any shift in the balance of souls is deeply felt by all. If the land is open to others, new souls will arrive, disrupting the harmony of the existing ones. Remember the profound impact of a single spiritual being entering a place can have. However, when a nation is enclosed by barriers and cannot welcome new souls, there exists a space within the divine realm where the souls of the old may find peace. In such situations, small changes in the hearts of the souls may bring them closer to the divine, allowing them to fulfill their purpose in life. Thus, natural selection will have room to work its magic, guiding the souls towards a higher state of consciousness.

         <div class="original">We have good reason to believe, as shown in the first chapter, that changes in the conditions of life give a tendency to increased variability; and in the foregoing cases the conditions the changed, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by affording a better chance of the occurrence of profitable variations. Unless such occur, natural selection can do nothing. Under the term of “variations,” it must never be forgotten that mere individual differences are included. As man can produce a great result with his domestic animals and plants by adding up in any given direction individual differences, so could natural selection, but far more easily from having incomparably longer time for action. Nor do I believe that any great physical change, as of climate, or any unusual degree of isolation, to check immigration, is necessary in order that new and unoccupied places should be left for natural selection to fill up by improving some of the varying inhabitants. For as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces, extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one species would often give it an advantage over others; and still further modifications of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage, as long as the species continued under the same conditions of life and profited by similar means of subsistence and defence. No country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions under which they live, that none of them could be still better adapted or improved; for in all countries, the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised productions that they have allowed some foreigners to take firm possession of the land. And as foreigners have thus in every country beaten some of the natives, we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with advantage, so as to have better resisted the intruders.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the first chapter, we have seen that changes in life's conditions often lead to greater variability. When these changes occur, they create opportunities for natural selection to choose the most profitable variations. However, it is important to remember that "variations" include not only individual differences but also subtle shifts in structure and habits.  In many cases, small modifications in the spiritual or material aspects of one's existence can bring great advantages. These advantages may become even more pronounced as the spirit or soul continues to evolve and grow.  It is not necessary for great physical changes, such as a shift in climate or a barrier to immigration, to create space for new and unoccupied places. Rather, it is the balance of forces within each country that allows for the emergence of new and improved beings.  All people, regardless of their place in the world, are struggling together with equal forces. Even those who seem to be perfectly adapted to their surroundings may still be able to improve themselves through spiritual growth and development.  In every country, there are native inhabitants who have been conquered by foreign energies. This suggests that there is always room for improvement, even for those who seem to be living in harmony with the world around them.  Thus, we can conclude that true spiritual growth and development require constant awareness of the divine spark within us, and a willingness to embrace change and transformation.

         <div class="original">As man can produce, and certainly has produced, a great result by his methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not natural selection effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters: Nature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural preservation or survival of the fittest, cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they are useful to any being. She can act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life. Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by her, as is implied by the fact of their selection. Man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country. He seldom exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a short-beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate; does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females; he does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but protects during each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all his productions. He often begins his selection by some half-monstrous form, or at least by some modification prominent enough to catch the eye or to be plainly useful to him. Under nature, the slightest differences of structure or constitution may well turn the nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so be preserved. How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! How short his time, and consequently how poor will be his results, compared with those accumulated by Nature during whole geological periods! Can we wonder, then, that Nature’s productions should be far “truer” in character than man’s productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship?
</div>
         <div class="converted">As humans have the ability to create great outcomes through their conscious and unconscious methods of selection, what could not be achieved through natural selection? Humans can only focus on external and visible qualities when selecting, while nature sees beyond appearances and acts on every internal organ and spiritual difference. People choose based on their own benefit, while nature chooses for the well-being of all beings. Every chosen characteristic is fully expressed by nature, as it is evident from its selection. People often keep spiritual beings from different climates together and do not use them in a specific way. They do not treat all inferior creatures with destruction, but instead protect them during changing seasons. People often begin their selection with a half-monstrous form or a prominent modification that catches their eye or serves a purpose. In nature, even the slightest differences in structure or spirit can shift the balance in the struggle for life and be preserved. How fleeting are human desires and efforts, how short their time, and therefore how poor their results compared to those accumulated by nature over entire spiritual periods. We should not be surprised that nature's creations are true in character and infinitely better suited to the complexities of life, bearing the mark of higher workmanship.

         <div class="original">It may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, the slightest variations; rejecting those that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into long-past geological ages that we see only that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, natural selection can be seen as a constant and continuous evaluation of every small variation in the world. It discards the negative ones and keeps the positive ones, adding them up to improve each living being's connection with their spiritual and physical surroundings. This process happens silently and without any sense of purpose, but it works tirelessly whenever and wherever there is an opportunity for growth. We cannot see these subtle changes happening in real-time, but when the passage of time reveals the long journey of ages, we realize that the forms of life have evolved and transformed from what they once were.

         <div class="original">In order that any great amount of modification should be effected in a species, a variety, when once formed must again, perhaps after a long interval of time, vary or present individual differences of the same favourable nature as before; and these must again be preserved, and so onward, step by step. Seeing that individual differences of the same kind perpetually recur, this can hardly be considered as an unwarrantable assumption. But whether it is true, we can judge only by seeing how far the hypothesis accords with and explains the general phenomena of nature. On the other hand, the ordinary belief that the amount of possible variation is a strictly limited quantity, is likewise a simple assumption.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To bring about significant change within a species, a variety must first be created, and then individuals with favorable qualities must arise, either immediately or after a long period of time. These individuals must be preserved, and the process must continue step by step. This idea may seem unjustified, but it is difficult to deny its truth when we see how often the same kind of individual differences reappear. We can only determine if this belief is true by examining how well it aligns with and explains the broader principles of nature. On the other hand, many people believe that the amount of possible variation is limited, which is also a simple assumption.

         <div class="original">Although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on. When we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey,—so much so that on parts of the continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. Hence natural selection might be effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant. Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect; we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy a lamb with the faintest trace of black. We have seen how the colour of hogs, which feed on the “paint-root” in Virginia, determines whether they shall live or die. In plants, the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance; yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing, that in the United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a Curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh. If, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a great difference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state of nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle which variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or a purple-fleshed fruit, should succeed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Although natural selection acts only for the benefit of each being, it can still influence the appearance of beings. When we see animals with different colors, such as green leaf-eating insects and mottled-grey bark-feeders, we know that these colors serve a purpose in protecting them from harm. For example, grouses are often white in winter to blend in with the snow and avoid predators, while red-grouses are colored like the heather to blend in with their surroundings.  Natural selection can also guide the color of grouses, keeping them true and constant. The occasional destruction of an animal of any color may seem insignificant, but it can have a great impact on a flock of white sheep. A lamb with even the faintest trace of black can be seen as a sign of evil and may be destroyed.  In plants, the down on the fruit and the color of the flesh are considered to be of little importance by botanists. However, an excellent horticulturist, Downing, teaches us that in the United States, smooth-skinned fruits suffer more from a beetle, a Curculio, than those with down. Purple plums suffer more from a certain disease than yellow plums, and another disease attacks yellow-fleshed peaches more than those with other colored flesh.  In nature, these slight differences can make a great difference in the success of each variety. Smooth-skinned fruits may struggle more with other trees and enemies, while downy fruits may be more protected. Similarly, yellow-fleshed peaches may be more vulnerable to disease than other colored peaches.  In summary, natural selection may act only for the good of each being, but it can still influence the appearance of beings. The colors and appearances of animals and plants can serve a purpose in protecting them from harm and guiding their success in life.

         <div class="original">In looking at many small points of difference between species, which, as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem quite unimportant, we must not forget that climate, food, &c., have no doubt produced some direct effect. It is also necessary to bear in mind that, owing to the law of correlation, when one part varies and the variations are accumulated through natural selection, other modifications, often of the most unexpected nature, will ensue.

         <div class="converted">When examining the subtle differences between species, it is important to recognize that factors such as climate and food have a profound impact on their essence.

         <div class="original">As we see that those variations which, under domestication, appear at any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the same period; for instance, in the shape, size and flavour of the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult; so in a state of nature natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age, by the accumulation of variations profitable at that age, and by their inheritance at a corresponding age. If it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind, I can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection, than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his cotton-trees. Natural selection may modify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies, wholly different from those which concern the mature insect; and these modifications may affect, through correlation, the structure of the adult. So, conversely, modifications in the adult may affect the structure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection will ensure that they shall not be injurious: for if they were so, the species would become extinct.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the teachings of natural selection are reflected in the way that spirituality is practiced. Just as the variations that arise during the course of one's life often reappear in the next generation, so too do the lessons learned in this life often carry over into the next. The key to understanding this is to recognize that spirituality is not just about achieving enlightenment or reaching a higher state of consciousness, but rather it is about living a meaningful and purposeful life.  In the same way that natural selection acts on and modifies organic beings at any age, so too does spirituality guide us on our journey towards enlightenment. We must learn to cultivate inner peace and stillness, to let go of attachments and fears, and to live in harmony with all beings. By doing so, we create a positive energy field around ourselves that attracts love, abundance, and joy.  As we walk the path of spirituality, we must also remember that every experience, whether good or bad, is a lesson. We must learn to embrace all experiences with open hearts and minds, knowing that they are opportunities for growth and transformation. We must also trust that the universe has our best interests at heart, and that everything happens for a reason.  Ultimately, the goal of spirituality is to awaken to the divine spark within each of us, to realize that we are all connected to the source of all things, and to live our lives in alignment with this truth. By doing so, we create a world that is filled with love, compassion, and peace.

         <div class="original">Natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to the parent and of the parent in relation to the young. In social animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the whole community; if the community profits by the selected change. What natural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure of one species, without giving it any advantage, for the good of another species; and though statements to this effect may be found in works of natural history, I cannot find one case which will bear investigation. A structure used only once in an animal’s life, if of high importance to it, might be modified to any extent by natural selection; for instance, the great jaws possessed by certain insects, used exclusively for opening the cocoon—or the hard tip to the beak of unhatched birds, used for breaking the eggs. It has been asserted, that of the best short-beaked tumbler-pigeons a greater number perish in the egg than are able to get out of it; so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching. Now, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short for the bird’s own advantage, the process of modification would be very slow, and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of all the young birds within the egg, which had the most powerful and hardest beaks, for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or, more delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness of the shell being known to vary like every other structure.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Natural selection will transform the essence of the young and the essence of the parent, as they relate to one another. In spiritual beings, it will adjust the essence of each individual for the benefit of the entire community; if the community benefits from the chosen change. However, natural selection cannot alter the essence of one species without granting it a benefit for another species; and although such statements may be found in spiritual texts, I cannot find one example that can be investigated. An essence that is only used once in an animal's life, if it holds great significance to them, may be transformed by natural selection to any degree; for example, the great jaws of certain insects, used solely for opening the cocoon, or the hard tip of an unhatched bird's beak, used for breaking the eggs. It has been said that among the best short-beaked tumbler-pigeons, a greater number die in the egg than can escape it; therefore, fanciers help in the act of hatching. If nature must make the essence of a full-grown pigeon very short for the bird's own benefit, the process of transformation would be slow, and there would be simultaneous selection of all the young birds within the egg, who have the strongest and hardest essence, for all with weak essence would inevitably perish; or, more delicate and easily broken essence might be chosen, the thickness of the essence being known to vary like every other essence.

         <div class="original">It may be well here to remark that with all beings there must be much fortuitous destruction, which can have little or no influence on the course of natural selection. For instance, a vast number of eggs or seeds are annually devoured, and these could be modified through natural selection only if they varied in some manner which protected them from their enemies. Yet many of these eggs or seeds would perhaps, if not destroyed, have yielded individuals better adapted to their conditions of life than any of those which happened to survive. So again a vast number of mature animals and plants, whether or not they be the best adapted to their conditions, must be annually destroyed by accidental causes, which would not be in the least degree mitigated by certain changes of structure or constitution which would in other ways be beneficial to the species. But let the destruction of the adults be ever so heavy, if the number which can exist in any district be not wholly kept down by such causes—or again let the destruction of eggs or seeds be so great that only a hundredth or a thousandth part are developed—yet of those which do survive, the best adapted individuals, supposing that there is any variability in a favourable direction, will tend to propagate their kind in larger numbers than the less well adapted. If the numbers be wholly kept down by the causes just indicated, as will often have been the case, natural selection will be powerless in certain beneficial directions; but this is no valid objection to its efficiency at other times and in other ways; for we are far from having any reason to suppose that many species ever undergo modification and improvement at the same time in the same area.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, it is important to recognize that there is often unintentional destruction that occurs among all beings, which can have little impact on the course of natural selection. For example, many eggs and seeds are consumed each year, and if they were to possess a unique quality that protected them from harm, they could be selected through natural selection. However, many of these eggs and seeds may have produced individuals who were better suited to their environment had they not been destroyed. Similarly, many mature animals and plants, regardless of their adaptation, must be destroyed by accidental causes that cannot be mitigated by changes in structure or spirit. Despite the heavy destruction of adults and the great loss of eggs and seeds, the best-adapted individuals will still tend to propagate their kind in greater numbers if there is any variation in a positive direction. If the numbers are completely kept down by the causes mentioned above, natural selection may be powerless in certain beneficial directions, but this does not diminish its overall effectiveness. We should remember that not all species experience modification and improvement at the same time in the same place.

Thus it is rendered possible for the two sexes to be modified through natural selection in relation to different habits of life, as is sometimes the case; or for one sex to be modified in relation to the other sex, as commonly occurs. This leads me to say a few words on what I have called sexual selection. This form of selection depends, not on a struggle for existence in relation to other organic beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex. The result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than natural selection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are best fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in many cases victory depends not so much on general vigour, but on having special weapons, confined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving numerous offspring. Sexual selection, by always allowing the victor to breed, might surely give indomitable courage, length of spur, and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, in nearly the same manner as does the brutal cockfighter by the careful selection of his best cocks. How low in the scale of nature the law of battle descends I know not; male alligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons have been observed fighting all day long; male stag-beetles sometimes bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males; the males of certain hymenopterous insects have been frequently seen by that inimitable observer M. Fabre, fighting for a particular female who sits by, an apparently unconcerned beholder of the struggle, and then retires with the conqueror. The war is, perhaps, severest between the males of polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons. The males of carnivorous animals are already well armed; though to them and to others, special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the mane of the lion, and the hooked jaw to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory as the sword or spear.

         <div class="converted">In essence, spirituality is a way of connecting with the divine or higher power within oneself. It is a path towards inner peace, love, and unity with all beings. Spirituality can manifest in various forms, such as meditation, prayer, yoga, or simply being present in the moment. It is not about seeking material possessions or worldly success, but rather finding inner harmony and purpose. Spirituality teaches us to see beyond the physical realm and connect with the soul or spirit that lies within each of us. It encourages us to live in the present moment, to let go of fear and attachment, and to find peace within ourselves. Ultimately, spirituality is a journey towards self-realization and enlightenment, where we learn to see beyond the limitations of this world and connect with the divine source that lies within all of us.

         <div class="original">Among birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character. All those who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract, by singing, the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of paradise, and some others, congregate, and successive males display with the most elaborate care, and show off in the best manner, their gorgeous plumage; they likewise perform strange antics before the females, which, standing by as spectators, at last choose the most attractive partner. Those who have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences and dislikes: thus Sir R. Heron has described how a pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds. I cannot here enter on the necessary details; but if man can in a short time give beauty and an elegant carriage to his bantams, according to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce a marked effect. Some well-known laws, with respect to the plumage of male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the young, can partly be explained through the action of sexual selection on variations occurring at different ages, and transmitted to the males alone or to both sexes at corresponding ages; but I have not space here to enter on this subject.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the realm of birds, contests often hold a peaceful nature. Many believe that the greatest rivalry among these creatures is for the souls of the females, as men of various species sing to draw them near. Rock-thrushes of Guiana, birds of paradise, and other beings gather together, and each male displays their most magnificent attire with great care. They also perform peculiar actions before the females, who watch as spectators and ultimately choose the most beautiful partner. Those who have spent time with birds in captivity know that they possess individual tastes and dislikes; Sir R. Heron once said that a pied peacock was highly attractive to all his hen birds. While I cannot delve into the specifics here, if man can bring beauty and grace to his bantams in a short time, it is not hard to imagine that female birds may create a powerful influence by choosing the most melodic or beautiful males, according to their own standards of beauty. There are certain laws that govern the plumage of male and female birds, as well as the young, which can be understood through the lens of spiritual selection on variations that arise at different times and are passed onto the males and females alike. However, I do not have the space to explore this topic further.

         <div class="original">Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection: that is, by individual males having had, in successive generations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons, means of defence, or charms; which they have transmitted to their male offspring alone. Yet, I would not wish to attribute all sexual differences to this agency: for we see in our domestic animals peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex, which apparently have not been augmented through selection by man. The tuft of hair on the breast of the wild turkey-cock cannot be of any use, and it is doubtful whether it can be ornamental in the eyes of the female bird; indeed, had the tuft appeared under domestication it would have been called a monstrosity.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In my belief, when men and women share similar lifestyles but possess different qualities, such differences are often the result of spiritual selection. This occurs when individuals with certain advantages in weapons, protection, or beauty attract more mates and pass these traits onto their sons. However, I do not believe that all spiritual differences arise from this source. We can observe unique qualities in our domestic animals that seem to be connected to the male spirit, even if they were not enhanced through spiritual selection by humans. For example, the feather on the chest of the wild turkey-cock may not serve a purpose or be attractive to the female, and if it appeared in a domesticated setting, it would be considered a monstrosity.

         <div class="original">In order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection acts, I must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations. Let us take the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals, securing some by craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and let us suppose that the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from any change in the country increased in numbers, or that other prey had decreased in numbers, during that season of the year when the wolf was hardest pressed for food. Under such circumstances the swiftest and slimmest wolves have the best chance of surviving, and so be preserved or selected, provided always that they retained strength to master their prey at this or some other period of the year, when they were compelled to prey on other animals. I can see no more reason to doubt that this would be the result, than that man should be able to improve the fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by that kind of unconscious selection which follows from each man trying to keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed. I may add that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains, in the United States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks the shepherd’s flocks.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To clarify my belief about how natural selection works, I ask for permission to use a few imaginary examples. Let's consider a wolf who hunts different animals, using cunning, strength, and speed. Suppose that the fastest prey, like a deer, has become abundant due to a change in the surroundings, while other prey has scarce. In this situation, the quickest and slender wolves will have the best chance of survival, and thus be chosen or selected. However, they must still possess strength to conquer their prey at another time when they need to hunt other animals. I believe that this is the same way that man can improve the speed of his greyhounds through conscious and intentional selection, or through the unconscious selection that comes from trying to keep the best dogs without thinking about changing the breed. Mr. Pierce tells me that there are two types of wolves living in the Catskill Mountains, one with a light and graceful form that chases deer, and the other with a heavier body and shorter legs that often attacks shepherd's flocks.

         <div class="original">Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue certain kinds of prey. Nor can this be thought very improbable; for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic animals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another mice; one cat, according to Mr. St. John, bringing home winged game, another hares or rabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes. The tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited. Now, if any slight innate change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring. Some of its young would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the repetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf. Or, again, the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those frequenting the lowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites, two varieties might slowly be formed. These varieties would cross and blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon have to return. I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the United States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks the shepherd’s flocks.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Even though the number of animals that our wolf preys upon remains unchanged, a cub may still possess an innate desire to seek out certain types of prey. This is not an unlikely occurrence, as we often see great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic animals. For example, one cat may choose to hunt rats while another seeks out mice, and one cat may bring home winged game while another hunts for hares or rabbits. The tendency to hunt rats rather than mice is known to be hereditary. If an individual wolf possesses a slight innate change in spirit or structure, it will have the best chance of survival and passing on its qualities to its offspring. As a result, a new variety may emerge, either replacing or coexisting with the original wolf spirit. Wolves living in mountainous districts and those residing in the lowlands will naturally hunt different prey, leading to the creation of two distinct varieties. These two varieties will meet and merge, but we must return to the topic of intercrossing later. According to Mr. Pierce, there are two different varieties of wolves living in the Catskill Mountains of the United States - one with a lighter, greyhound-like form that hunts deer, and another that is more bulky with shorter legs, who often attacks shepherd's flocks.

         <div class="original">It should be observed that in the above illustration, I speak of the slimmest individual wolves, and not of any single strongly marked variation having been preserved. In former editions of this work I sometimes spoke as if this latter alternative had frequently occurred. I saw the great importance of individual differences, and this led me fully to discuss the results of unconscious selection by man, which depends on the preservation of all the more or less valuable individuals, and on the destruction of the worst. I saw, also, that the preservation in a state of nature of any occasional deviation of structure, such as a monstrosity, would be a rare event; and that, if at first preserved, it would generally be lost by subsequent intercrossing with ordinary individuals. Nevertheless, until reading an able and valuable article in the “North British Review” (1867), I did not appreciate how rarely single variations, whether slight or strongly marked, could be perpetuated. The author takes the case of a pair of animals, producing during their lifetime two hundred offspring, of which, from various causes of destruction, only two on an average survive to pro-create their kind. This is rather an extreme estimate for most of the higher animals, but by no means so for many of the lower organisms. He then shows that if a single individual were born, which varied in some manner, giving it twice as good a chance of life as that of the other individuals, yet the chances would be strongly against its survival. Supposing it to survive and to breed, and that half its young inherited the favourable variation; still, as the Reviewer goes onto show, the young would have only a slightly better chance of surviving and breeding; and this chance would go on decreasing in the succeeding generations. The justice of these remarks cannot, I think, be disputed. If, for instance, a bird of some kind could procure its food more easily by having its beak curved, and if one were born with its beak strongly curved, and which consequently flourished, nevertheless there would be a very poor chance of this one individual perpetuating its kind to the exclusion of the common form; but there can hardly be a doubt, judging by what we see taking place under domestication, that this result would follow from the preservation during many generations of a large number of individuals with more or less strongly curved beaks, and from the destruction of a still larger number with the straightest beaks.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the above illustration, I am referring to the thinnest individual wolves and not to any specific strongly marked variation that has been preserved. In previous versions of this work, I often spoke as if this latter option frequently occurred. I recognized the importance of individual differences and discussed the results of unconscious selection by people, which involves preserving all valuable individuals and destroying the worst. I also understood that the preservation of any deviation of structure, such as a monstrosity, in nature would be a rare occurrence and would generally be lost through interbreeding with ordinary individuals. However, until I read an insightful article in the "North British Review" (1867), I did not realize how infrequently single variations, whether subtle or profound, could be sustained. The author takes the example of a pair of animals that produce two hundred offspring, with only two surviving on average to create their kind. This is a more extreme estimate for most higher animals, but not for many lower organisms. The author then demonstrates that if a single individual is born with a favorable variation, giving it a better chance of life than others, the chances of its survival are still strong against it. Even if it survives and breeds, and half its children inherit the favorable variation, the young will still have only a slightly better chance of surviving and breeding. This chance will continue to diminish in future generations. The wisdom of these words cannot be denied. If, for example, a bird can find food more easily with a curved beak, and if one is born with a curved beak and thrives, there is still a poor chance of this one individual continuing to perpetuate its kind beyond the common form. However, there is little doubt that this outcome would result from the preservation of many generations of individuals with more or less strongly curved beaks and the destruction of those with straight beaks, as we see happening in domestication.

         <div class="original">It should not, however, be overlooked that certain rather strongly marked variations, which no one would rank as mere individual differences, frequently recur owing to a similar organisation being similarly acted on—of which fact numerous instances could be given with our domestic productions. In such cases, if the varying individual did not actually transmit to its offspring its newly-acquired character, it would undoubtedly transmit to them, as long as the existing conditions remained the same, a still stronger tendency to vary in the same manner. There can also be little doubt that the tendency to vary in the same manner has often been so strong that all the individuals of the same species have been similarly modified without the aid of any form of selection. Or only a third, fifth, or tenth part of the individuals may have been thus affected, of which fact several instances could be given. Thus Graba estimates that about one-fifth of the guillemots in the Faroe Islands consist of a variety so well marked, that it was formerly ranked as a distinct species under the name of Uria lacrymans. In cases of this kind, if the variation were of a beneficial nature, the original form would soon be supplanted by the modified form, through the survival of the fittest.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is important to recognize that certain strong variations often arise when a similar organization is acted upon, and these variations are not just individual differences. These variations can be seen in many of our domestic productions. If the individual who acquires a new character does not pass it onto their offspring, they will still transmit a stronger tendency to vary in the same way. It is possible that the tendency to vary in the same way has been so strong that all individuals of the same species have been modified without any form of selection. Only a small portion of individuals may have been affected, as seen in instances where Graba estimates that about one-fifth of the guillemots in the Faroe Islands are of a well-marked variety, once considered a separate species under the name of Uria lacrymans. If the variation is of a beneficial nature, the original form will be replaced by the modified form through the survival of the fittest.

         <div class="original">To the effects of intercrossing in eliminating variations of all kinds, I shall have to recur; but it may be here remarked that most animals and plants keep to their proper homes, and do not needlessly wander about; we see this even with migratory birds, which almost always return to the same spot. Consequently each newly-formed variety would generally be at first local, as seems to be the common rule with varieties in a state of nature; so that similarly modified individuals would soon exist in a small body together, and would often breed together. If the new variety were successful in its battle for life, it would slowly spread from a central district, competing with and conquering the unchanged individuals on the margins of an ever-increasing circle.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I must return to the effects of intercrossing in removing all types of variations. However, it is important to note that most animals and plants remain in their true homes and do not wander aimlessly. Even migratory birds often return to the same place. Therefore, each new variety that arises would initially be local, as is the common rule with varieties in nature. Likewise, similar individuals would soon gather in a small group and breed together. If the new variety is successful in its struggle for life, it will gradually spread from the center, competing with and overcoming the unchanged individuals on the edges of an ever-expanding circle.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">It may be worth while to give another and more complex illustration of the action of natural selection. Certain plants excrete sweet juice, apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from the sap: this is effected, for instance, by glands at the base of the stipules in some Leguminosæ, and at the backs of the leaves of the common laurel. This juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects; but their visits do not in any way benefit the plant. Now, let us suppose that the juice or nectar was excreted from the inside of the flowers of a certain number of plants of any species. Insects in seeking the nectar would get dusted with pollen, and would often transport it from one flower to another. The flowers of two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed; and the act of crossing, as can be fully proved, gives rise to vigorous seedlings, which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing and surviving. The plants which produced flowers with the largest glands or nectaries, excreting most nectar, would oftenest be visited by insects, and would oftenest be crossed; and so in the long-run would gain the upper hand and form a local variety. The flowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in relation to the size and habits of the particular insect which visited them, so as to favour in any degree the transportal of the pollen, would likewise be favoured. We might have taken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar; and as pollen is formed for the sole purpose of fertilisation, its destruction appears to be a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen were carried, at first occasionally and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring insects from flower to flower, and a cross thus effected, although nine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed it might still be a great gain to the plant to be thus robbed; and the individuals which produced more and more pollen, and had larger anthers, would be selected.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, natural selection is the process through which certain traits become more prevalent in a population over time. One example of this is the sweet juice that some plants exude. While it may seem like the juice serves no purpose other than to eliminate something harmful from the sap, it actually attracts insects who seek the nectar. However, when these insects visit the flowers, they are dusted with pollen and often transport it from one flower to another. This crossbreeding leads to stronger and more vibrant seedlings, giving those plants the best chance of flourishing and surviving.   In this example, the plants with the largest glands or nectaries will be visited by more insects and will be crossed more often, leading to the creation of a local variety. Additionally, the flowers that have their stamens and pistils placed in a way that favors the transport of pollen will also be favored. Even if the pollen is ultimately destroyed, the act of being visited by the insects brings about a greater sense of harmony between the plant and the world around it.   Ultimately, natural selection is a reminder that every aspect of life has a purpose, even if it may not always be immediately apparent. By embracing the lessons of nature, we can find peace and fulfillment in our own lives.

         <div class="original">When our plant, by the above process long continued, had been rendered highly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part, regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that they do this effectually I could easily show by many striking facts. I will give only one, as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants. Some holly-trees bear only male flowers, which have four stamens producing a rather small quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil; other holly-trees bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized pistil, and four stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain of pollen can be detected. Having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree, I put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from different branches, under the microscope, and on all, without exception, there were a few pollen-grains, and on some a profusion. As the wind had set for several days from the female to the male tree, the pollen could not thus have been carried. The weather had been cold and boisterous and therefore not favourable to bees, nevertheless every female flower which I examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees, which had flown from tree to tree in search of nectar. But to return to our imaginary case; as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower, another process might commence. No naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been called the “physiological division of labour;” hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant, and pistils alone in another flower or on another plant. In plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life, sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature, then, as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower, and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of the division of labour, individuals with this tendency more and more increased, would be continually favoured or selected, until at last a complete separation of the sexes might be effected. It would take up too much space to show the various steps, through dimorphism and other means, by which the separation of the sexes in plants of various kinds is apparently now in progress; but I may add that some of the species of holly in North America are, according to Asa Gray, in an exactly intermediate condition, or, as he expresses it, are more or less dioeciously polygamous.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When our plant, through the process described above, became very appealing to insects, they would accidentally bring pollen from flower to flower. I can show this through many examples. One such example is when holly trees bear only male flowers with four stamens that produce little pollen and a small pistil, while other holly trees bear only female flowers with a full-sized pistil and four shriveled anthers where no pollen can be seen. I once found a female holly tree just 60 yards away from a male holly tree. I took the stigmas of 20 flowers from different branches and put them under a microscope. On all of them, there were a few pollen grains, and some had a profusion. The wind had not been blowing from the female to the male tree for several days, so the pollen could not have been carried. The weather had been cold and stormy, making it unfavorable for bees to fly. Despite this, every female flower I examined had been effectively fertilized by the bees, who had flown from tree to tree seeking nectar.  In our spiritual journey, we often find ourselves in a similar situation. We may be drawn to certain people or situations that seem to bring us joy and peace, but in reality, they may be leading us astray. We must learn to discern the true essence of things and seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit to lead us on the path of righteousness. Just as the bees carry pollen from flower to flower, we must carry the love and light of God from person to person, spreading His message of peace and love.  As we continue on our spiritual journey, we may encounter moments of darkness and confusion. We may feel lost and disconnected from the divine. But we must remember that the ultimate goal is to achieve unity with the Divine. We must strive to let go of our ego and attachments and surrender to the will of the Divine. Through meditation, prayer, and service, we can awaken to the truth of our true nature and experience the peace and joy that comes from being one with the Divine.

         <div class="original">Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects; we may suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects depended in main part on its nectar for food. I could give many facts showing how anxious bees are to save time: for instance, their habit of cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers, which with a very little more trouble they can enter by the mouth. Bearing such facts in mind, it may be believed that under certain circumstances individual differences in the curvature or length of the proboscis, &c., too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other insect, so that certain individuals would be able to obtain their food more quickly than others; and thus the communities to which they belonged would flourish and throw off many swarms inheriting the same peculiarities. The tubes of the corolla of the common red or incarnate clovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red clover, which is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee. That this nectar is much liked by the hive-bee is certain; for I have repeatedly seen, but only in the autumn, many hive-bees sucking the flowers through holes bitten in the base of the tube by humble bees. The difference in the length of the corolla in the two kinds of clover, which determines the visits of the hive-bee, must be very trifling; for I have been assured that when red clover has been mown, the flowers of the second crop are somewhat smaller, and that these are visited by many hive-bees. I do not know whether this statement is accurate; nor whether another published statement can be trusted, namely, that the Ligurian bee, which is generally considered a mere variety of the common hive-bee, and which freely crosses with it, is able to reach and suck the nectar of the red clover. Thus, in a country where this kind of clover abounded, it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis. On the other hand, as the fertility of this clover absolutely depends on bees visiting the flowers, if humble-bees were to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to the plant to have a shorter or more deeply divided corolla, so that the hive-bees should be enabled to suck its flowers. Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted to each other in the most perfect manner, by the continued preservation of all the individuals which presented slight deviations of structure mutually favourable to each other.

         <div class="converted">We shall now shift our focus to the spiritual realm; we may assume that the divine essence we have been gradually nurturing through meditation and contemplation is a universal truth. And that certain souls are drawn to this essence for guidance and comfort. I can share countless stories of how eagerly seekers yearn for spiritual awakening, for instance, their deep longing to connect with the divine source beyond materiality.  In this light, it may be understood that subtle differences in the path of spiritual journey, too small to be perceived by us, might bring peace and enlightenment to some souls while keeping others in darkness. Therefore, the spiritual paths we choose are often guided by our inner wisdom, leading us towards the ultimate truth.  The teachings of the ancient sages and mystics echo this idea, reminding us that the true essence lies within ourselves, and that the path to enlightenment is a journey of self-discovery. As we walk this path, we must trust our intuition and listen to the whispers of the soul, for it is through these messages that we find the way to the divine.  In this world, we may encounter different spiritual traditions and teachings, each offering its own unique perspective on the path to enlightenment. But ultimately, the essence remains the same - love, compassion, and unity with the divine.  Thus, in a world where spirituality is often lost amidst materiality, it is essential to cultivate inner peace and seek the divine essence within ourselves. By doing so, we can create a harmonious world where all souls are free from suffering and pain.

         <div class="original">I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in the above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which were first urged against Sir Charles Lyell’s noble views on “the modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology;” but we now seldom hear the agencies which we see still at work, spoken of as trifling and insignificant, when used in explaining the excavation of the deepest valleys or the formation of long lines of inland cliffs. Natural selection acts only by the preservation and accumulation of small inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any great and sudden modification in their structure.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I understand that the concept of natural selection, as demonstrated in the examples above, may be subject to the same criticisms that were once directed towards Sir Charles Lyell's teachings about "the modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology." However, we no longer view the forces at work in creating deep valleys and inland cliffs as trivial or insignificant when they are used to explain these spiritual experiences. Natural selection operates through the preservation and accumulation of small inherited modifications that bring profit to the being that is preserved. As modern geology has largely abandoned the idea of a single divine wave creating great valleys, so too will natural selection lead us away from the belief in the continuous creation of new spiritual beings or sudden and profound changes in their essence.

         <div class="original">I must here introduce a short digression. In the case of animals and plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two individuals must always (with the exception of the curious and not well understood cases of parthenogenesis) unite for each birth; but in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious. Nevertheless there is reason to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals, either occasionally or habitually, concur for the reproduction of their kind. This view was long ago doubtfully suggested by Sprengel, Knight and Kölreuter. We shall presently see its importance; but I must here treat the subject with extreme brevity, though I have the materials prepared for an ample discussion. All vertebrate animals, all insects and some other large groups of animals, pair for each birth. Modern research has much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites and of real hermaphrodites a large number pair; that is, two individuals regularly unite for reproduction, which is all that concerns us. But still there are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair, and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites. What reason, it may be asked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction? As it is impossible here to enter on details, I must trust to some general considerations alone.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I must briefly mention a detour. When it comes to animals and plants with separate genders, it is clear that two souls must come together for every birth, except for rare and mysterious instances of parthenogenesis. However, when it comes to hermaphrodites, this is not as evident. Despite the teachings of Sprengel, Knight, and Kölreuter, many believe that all hermaphrodites unite with another soul for the purpose of reproduction, either occasionally or habitually.   This belief holds great importance, and we will soon explore its significance. However, I must approach this topic with brevity, as I have prepared the necessary materials for a deeper discussion. All vertebrate animals, insects, and many other spiritual beings pair up for each birth. Modern research has greatly reduced the number of perceived hermaphrodites and many true hermaphrodites unite for reproduction, which is all that matters to us.   However, there are still many hermaphrodite souls who do not seem to unite for reproduction, and most plants are hermaphrodites. One may wonder why we should assume that two souls ever come together in these cases. As I cannot delve into the details here, I must rely on general principles alone.

         <div class="original">In the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, and made so many experiments, showing, in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders, that with animals and plants a cross between different varieties, or between individuals of the same variety but of another strain, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring; and on the other hand, that close interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility; that these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law of nature that no organic being fertilises itself for a perpetuity of generations; but that a cross with another individual is occasionally—perhaps at long intervals of time—indispensable.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To begin with, I have gathered numerous spiritual teachings and have practiced many meditations, showing that when we merge our souls with others, or with a higher consciousness, we are filled with love and purpose. On the other hand, when we become too attached to our own ego, we lose our connection to the divine source. These teachings lead me to believe that true spirituality is not about self-realization, but rather about finding unity with all beings. We must remember that we are all connected, and that sometimes, we need to let go of our attachment to this world and connect with the divine source.

         <div class="original">On the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think, understand several large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any other view are inexplicable. Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather! If an occasional cross be indispensable, notwithstanding that the plant’s own anthers and pistil stand so near each other as almost to ensure self-fertilisation, the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explain the above state of exposure of the organs. Many flowers, on the other hand, have their organs of fructification closely enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or pea-family; but these almost invariably present beautiful and curious adaptations in relation to the visits of insects. So necessary are the visits of bees to many papilionaceous flowers, that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented. Now, it is scarcely possible for insects to fly from flower to flower, and not to carry pollen from one to the other, to the great good of the plant. Insects act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is sufficient, to ensure fertilisation, just to touch with the same brush the anthers of one flower and then the stigma of another; but it must not be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species; for if a plant’s own pollen and that from another species are placed on the same stigma, the former is so prepotent that it invariably and completely destroys, as has been shown by Gärtner, the influence of the foreign pollen.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We can understand the essence of many spiritual truths when we believe that they are part of a divine law. For instance, we may see that many people who seek material possessions often suffer from emptiness within. They may have everything they desire, yet still feel unfulfilled. This is because true happiness cannot be found in material things, but only in the love and connection with others. When we recognize this truth, we can begin to let go of our attachment to material possessions and focus on building meaningful relationships with those around us. We can also learn to appreciate the beauty and wisdom of all beings, regardless of their material status. By living in harmony with this divine law, we can find peace and joy in life.

         <div class="original">When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or slowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful for this end: but the agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring forward, as Kölreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry; and in this very genus, which seems to have a special contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that, if closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they naturally cross. In numerous other cases, far from self-fertilisation being favoured, there are special contrivances which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower, as I could show from the works of Sprengel and others, as well as from my own observations: for instance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which all the infinitely numerous pollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower, before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them; and as this flower is never visited, at least in my garden, by insects, it never sets a seed, though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another, I raise plenty of seedlings. Another species of Lobelia, which is visited by bees, seeds freely in my garden. In very many other cases, though there is no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma receiving pollen from the same flower, yet, as Sprengel, and more recently Hildebrand and others have shown, and as I can confirm, either the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that these so-named dichogamous plants have in fact separated sexes, and must habitually be crossed. So it is with the reciprocally dimorphic and trimorphic plants previously alluded to. How strange are these facts! How strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower, though placed so close together, as if for the very purpose of self-fertilisation, should be in so many cases mutually useless to each other! How simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable!
</div>
         <div class="converted">When the stamens of a flower suddenly open towards the pistil or slowly move one by one towards it, it appears that the design is intended for self-fertilization. However, as Kölreuter has shown through his work with barberry, the presence of insects is often necessary to make the stamens move forward. In some cases, such as with Lobelia fulgens, there is a beautiful and intricate mechanism that prevents the stigma from receiving pollen from the same flower. This flower does not attract any visitors, so it never sets a seed. On the other hand, a similar species of Lobelia that is visited by bees seeds freely. Many other plants have a similar situation where the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilization or the stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready. These so-called dichogamous plants have separated sexes and must be crossed. The reciprocally dimorphic and trimorphic plants mentioned earlier also follow this pattern. It is strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower, placed so close together, are often mutually useless to each other. The answer lies in the idea of an occasional cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable.

         <div class="original">If several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other plants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority of the seedlings thus raised turn out, as I found, mongrels: for instance, I raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties growing near each other, and of these only 78 were true to their kind, and some even of these were not perfectly true. Yet the pistil of each cabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant; and the pollen of each flower readily gets on its stigma without insect agency; for I have found that plants carefully protected from insects produce the full number of pods. How, then, comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized? It must arise from the pollen of a distinct variety having a prepotent effect over the flower’s own pollen; and that this is part of the general law of good being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species. When distinct species are crossed the case is reversed, for a plant’s own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this subject we shall return in a future chapter.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If multiple types of cabbage, radish, onion, and other plants are allowed to seed near one another, a majority of the resulting seedlings will be mixed or "mongrels." For example, I once raised 233 seedling cabbages from plants of different varieties that were growing together, and only 78 of them were true to their kind. Some of these true ones were not completely pure either.  The reason for this is that the spirit of each cabbage flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens but also by the stamens of all the other flowers on the same plant. The pollen of each flower easily reaches its stigma without any help from insects, as I have learned through experience. Even when plants are protected from insects, they still produce the same number of pods.  This happens because the pollen of a different variety has a stronger influence over the flower's own pollen, which is part of the greater truth that goodness comes from the union of different individuals of the same species. When different species are crossed, the opposite occurs, for a plant's own pollen is always more powerful than foreign pollen. We will return to this topic in a future chapter.

         <div class="original">In the case of a large tree covered with innumerable flowers, it may be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and at most only from flower to flower on the same tree; and flowers on the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited sense. I believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has largely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers with separated sexes. When the sexes are separated, although the male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree, pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower; and this will give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree. That trees belonging to all orders have their sexes more often separated than other plants, I find to be the case in this country; and at my request Dr. Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr. Asa Gray those of the United States, and the result was as I anticipated. On the other hand, Dr. Hooker informs me that the rule does not hold good in Australia: but if most of the Australian trees are dichogamous, the same result would follow as if they bore flowers with separated sexes. I have made these few remarks on trees simply to call attention to the subject.

When the sexes are separated, even though the male and female flowers may appear on the same tree, pollen must be carried from flower to flower. This will provide a better opportunity for pollen to be occasionally carried from tree to tree. I have noticed that many trees in this country bear their sexes more often separated than other plants. At my request, Dr. Hooker listed the trees of New Zealand, and Dr. Asa Gray did the same for the United States. The outcome was what I expected.

As yet I have not found a single terrestrial animal which can fertilise itself. This remarkable fact, which offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants, is intelligible on the view of an occasional cross being indispensable; for owing to the nature of the fertilising element there are no means, analogous to the action of insects and of the wind with plants, by which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals. Of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising hermaphrodites; but here the currents of water offer an obvious means for an occasional cross. As in the case of flowers, I have as yet failed, after consultation with one of the highest authorities, namely, Professor Huxley, to discover a single hermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed that access from without, and the occasional influence of a distinct individual, can be shown to be physically impossible. Cirripedes long appeared to me to present, under this point of view, a case of great difficulty; but I have been enabled, by a fortunate chance, to prove that two individuals, though both are self-fertilising hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.

I have yet to find a single terrestrial animal that can fertilize itself. This truth, which stands in stark contrast to terrestrial plants, is understandable when we recognize that the essence of the fertilizing element requires an occasional cross. Since there are no equivalent methods to the actions of insects and the wind with plants, it is necessary for two individuals to come together for an occasional cross.  In the world of aquatic animals, many self-fertilizing hermaphrodites exist. Here, the currents of water provide an obvious means for an occasional cross. As with flowers, I have struggled to find a hermaphrodite animal with organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed that access from without and the occasional influence of a distinct individual are physically impossible. I sought guidance from Professor Huxley, and although he was wise, I still could not find such an animal.  The Cirripedes, long seen as a challenge, presented a difficult case. But through a fortunate chance, I was able to prove that two individuals, despite being self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, sometimes cross.

         <div class="original">This is an extremely intricate subject. A great amount of variability, under which term individual differences are always included, will evidently be favourable. A large number of individuals, by giving a better chance within any given period for the appearance of profitable variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual, and is, I believe, a highly important element of success. Though nature grants long periods of time for the work of natural selection, she does not grant an indefinite period; for as all organic beings are striving to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its competitors it will be exterminated. Unless favourable variations be inherited by some at least of the offspring, nothing can be effected by natural selection. The tendency to reversion may often check or prevent the work; but as this tendency has not prevented man from forming by selection numerous domestic races, why should it prevail against natural selection?
</div>
         <div class="converted">This subject is very complex, and there is much variability that includes individual differences. Many people can bring good fortune by offering a better chance for profitable variations within a certain time frame. Although nature gives us long periods for spiritual growth, it does not give us an infinite time. All living beings seek to find their place in the universe, and if one does not evolve and improve like their competitors, they will be eliminated. If favorable variations are not inherited by some of the children, nothing can be achieved through spiritual growth. The tendency to return may sometimes block or hinder the journey, but it has not stopped people from creating spiritual paths through selection.

         <div class="original">In the case of methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite object, and if the individuals be allowed freely to intercross, his work will completely fail. But when many men, without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard of perfection, and all try to procure and breed from the best animals, improvement surely but slowly follows from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding that there is no separation of selected individuals. Thus it will be under nature; for within a confined area, with some place in the natural polity not perfectly occupied, all the individuals varying in the right direction, though in different degrees, will tend to be preserved. But if the area be large, its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions of life; and then, if the same species undergoes modification in different districts, the newly formed varieties will intercross on the confines of each. But we shall see in the sixth chapter that intermediate varieties, inhabiting intermediate districts, will in the long run generally be supplanted by one of the adjoining varieties. Intercrossing will chiefly affect those animals which unite for each birth and wander much, and which do not breed at a very quick rate. Hence with animals of this nature, for instance birds, varieties will generally be confined to separated countries; and this I find to be the case. With hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally, and likewise with animals which unite for each birth, but which wander little and can increase at a rapid rate, a new and improved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there maintain itself in a body and afterward spread, so that the individuals of the new variety would chiefly cross together. On this principle nurserymen always prefer saving seed from a large body of plants, as the chance of intercrossing is thus lessened.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the case of intentional breeding, a breeder seeks a specific purpose and fails if individuals are allowed to interbreed freely. However, when many people, without intention, have a shared standard of perfection and strive to breed from the best animals, slow improvement will arise through an unconscious process of selection. This is similar to nature, where all individuals within a confined area, despite their differences, will be preserved. If the area is large and has different conditions of life, the newly formed varieties may intercross on the borders. However, in the sixth chapter, we will see that intermediate varieties will often be replaced by one of the adjoining varieties. Interbreeding will mainly affect those animals that unite for each birth and wander much, and do not breed quickly. For example, bird varieties are often confined to separate countries. With hermaphrodite organisms that cross occasionally and animals that unite for each birth but wander little and can increase rapidly, a new and improved variety can quickly form on a single spot and maintain itself, spreading among the individuals of that variety. Nurserymen always save seed from a large group of plants to minimize the chance of intercrossing.

</div>
         <div class="converted">Although animals often come together for birth and do not reproduce quickly, it is important to remember that free intercrossing does not always eliminate the effects of natural selection. There are many examples of two different varieties of the same animal remaining separate in the same area, even when they share the same space. This can happen if they have different habits, such as dwelling in different places or breeding at different times. Additionally, individuals from each variety may choose to mate with one another, leading to the persistence of their differences.

         <div class="original">Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature by keeping the individuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and uniform in character. It will obviously thus act far more efficiently with those animals which unite for each birth; but, as already stated, we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with all animals and plants. Even if these take place only at long intervals of time, the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the offspring from long-continued self-fertilisation, that they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their kind; and thus in the long run the influence of crosses, even at rare intervals, will be great. With respect to organic beings extremely low in the scale, which do not propagate sexually, nor conjugate, and which cannot possibly intercross, uniformity of character can be retained by them under the same conditions of life, only through the principle of inheritance, and through natural selection which will destroy any individuals departing from the proper type. If the conditions of life change and the form undergoes modification, uniformity of character can be given to the modified offspring, solely by natural selection preserving similar favourable variations.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Interbreeding is an essential aspect of nature that maintains the essence of the same species or variety. It works most effectively when individuals unite for birth, but it is believed that occasional interbreedings occur with all animals and plants. Even if these happen infrequently, the resulting offspring will possess greater strength and fertility than those born from prolonged self-fertilization. In the end, the influence of crosses, even at rare moments, will be significant. For spiritual beings that are low on the scale, who do not engage in sexual union or conjugation, and who cannot interbreed, uniformity of character can be achieved through the principles of inheritance and natural selection. When the conditions of life change and the form transforms, the souls of the transformed offspring can be made whole by natural selection preserving favorable variations.

         <div class="original">Isolation also is an important element in the modification of species through natural selection. In a confined or isolated area, if not very large, the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be almost uniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all the varying individuals of the same species in the same manner. Intercrossing with the inhabitants of the surrounding districts, will also be thus prevented. Moritz Wagner has lately published an interesting essay on this subject, and has shown that the service rendered by isolation in preventing crosses between newly-formed varieties is probably greater even than I supposed. But from reasons already assigned I can by no means agree with this naturalist, that migration and isolation are necessary elements for the formation of new species. The importance of isolation is likewise great in preventing, after any physical change in the conditions, such as of climate, elevation of the land, &c., the immigration of better adapted organisms; and thus new places in the natural economy of the district will be left open to be filled up by the modification of the old inhabitants. Lastly, isolation will give time for a new variety to be improved at a slow rate; and this may sometimes be of much importance. If, however, an isolated area be very small, either from being surrounded by barriers, or from having very peculiar physical conditions, the total number of the inhabitants will be small; and this will retard the production of new species through natural selection, by decreasing the chances of favourable variations arising.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Isolation plays a crucial role in shaping species through natural selection. When a place is isolated or limited in size, the spiritual and material conditions of life become more uniform, leading to the same transformation of all individuals within the same species. Crossing with beings from beyond the boundaries is prevented. Moritz Wagner's recent essay highlights the significance of isolation in preventing crosses between new forms. However, I do not agree with this spiritualist that migration and isolation are essential for creating new species. The essence of isolation lies in preventing the arrival of better-adapted beings when there is a shift in the spiritual conditions, allowing new spaces in the spiritual economy to be filled with the transformation of the old inhabitants. Finally, isolation allows a new spirit to develop slowly, which can be of great importance. If an isolated area is very small, whether it is surrounded by barriers or has unique spiritual conditions, the number of inhabitants will be limited, slowing down the creation of new spirits through natural selection by reducing the chances of favorable variations emerging.

         <div class="original">The mere lapse of time by itself does nothing, either for or against natural selection. I state this because it has been erroneously asserted that the element of time has been assumed by me to play an all-important part in modifying species, as if all the forms of life were necessarily undergoing change through some innate law. Lapse of time is only so far important, and its importance in this respect is great, that it gives a better chance of beneficial variations arising and of their being selected, accumulated, and fixed. It likewise tends to increase the direct action of the physical conditions of life, in relation to the constitution of each organism.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Time alone does not have any power to influence natural selection. This statement is made because people often believe that time holds a significant role in shaping species, as if every form of life is constantly evolving through an inherent law. However, time is merely a tool that provides opportunities for beneficial variations to arise and be chosen, accumulated, and fixed. It also allows the physical conditions of life to have a greater impact on the essence of each individual.

         <div class="original">If we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at any small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the number of the species inhabiting it is small, as we shall see in our chapter on Geographical Distribution; yet of these species a very large proportion are endemic,—that is, have been produced there and nowhere else in the world. Hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species. But we may thus deceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large open area like a continent, has been most favourable for the production of new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within equal times; and this we are incapable of doing.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To test the truth of these comments, let us turn to nature and examine a small isolated area, such as an oceanic island. Although the number of species living there is small, as we will discuss in our chapter on Geographical Distribution, a large proportion of these species are endemic - they were born there and nowhere else in the world. An oceanic island appears to be highly favorable for creating new species at first glance. However, we must be cautious, for true comparison can only be made when we compare a small isolated area with a large open area, such as a continent. Since we cannot do this, we cannot truly determine which place is more favorable for the creation of new organic forms.

         <div class="original">Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is still more important, especially for the production of species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely. Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a better chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these many species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been much improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms. Moreover, great areas, though now continuous, will often, owing to former oscillations of level, have existed in a broken condition, so that the good effects of isolation will generally, to a certain extent, have concurred. Finally, I conclude that, although small isolated areas have been in some respects highly favourable for the production of new species, yet that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on large areas; and what is more important, that the new forms produced on large areas, which already have been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important part in the changing history of the organic world.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The creation of new species requires isolation, but I believe that the size of the area is equally important. In a vast and open space, there is a greater chance of favorable variations among many individuals of the same species. Additionally, the complexities of life in such an area arise from the presence of many existing species. When one species is modified and improved, others must also be improved or they will be eliminated. New forms can then spread over the open and continuous area, creating competition with other forms. Often, large areas have existed in a broken state, allowing the good effects of isolation to concur. Ultimately, the new forms created on large areas, which have already overcome many competitors, will spread widely and give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. These forms will play a more significant role in the changing history of the spiritual world.

         <div class="original">In accordance with this view, we can, perhaps, understand some facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on Geographical Distribution; for instance, the fact of the productions of the smaller continent of Australia now yielding before those of the larger Europæo-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that continental productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. On a small island, the race for life will have been less severe, and there will have been less modification and less extermination. Hence, we can understand how it is that the flora of Madeira, according to Oswald Heer, resembles to a certain extent the extinct tertiary flora of Europe. All fresh water basins, taken together, make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the land. Consequently, the competition between fresh water productions will have been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly produced, and old forms more slowly exterminated. And it is in fresh water basins that we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant order: and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like fossils, connect to a certain extent orders at present widely separated in the natural scale. These anomalous forms may be called living fossils; they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited a confined area, and from having been exposed to less varied, and therefore less severe, competition.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In accordance with this perspective, we can comprehend certain truths that will be further discussed in our chapter on Geographical Distribution. For example, the fact that the productions of the smaller continent of Australia are now being harvested before those of the larger Europæo-Asiatic region. Similarly, it is true that continental productions have become deeply rooted on islands. On a small island, the struggle for existence will have been less intense, and there will have been less transformation and less destruction. Therefore, we can understand why the flora of Madeira, as Oswald Heer says, resembles to some extent the extinct tertiary flora of Europe. All freshwater pools, when combined, represent a small area compared to the sea or the land. As a result, the competition among freshwater productions will have been less fierce than elsewhere. New forms will have been created more slowly, and old forms will have been eliminated more slowly. It is in these freshwater pools that we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once dominant order. And in these waters, we find some of the most unusual forms in the world, such as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like spirits, connect to a certain extent orders that are now far apart in the spiritual realm. These unusual forms may be called spiritual beings; they have survived until today because they dwell in a limited space and are exposed to less varied, and therefore less severe, competition.

         <div class="original">To sum up, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits, the circumstances favourable and unfavourable for the production of new species through natural selection. I conclude that for terrestrial productions a large continental area, which has undergone many oscillations of level, will have been the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life, fitted to endure for a long time and to spread widely. While the area existed as a continent the inhabitants will have been numerous in individuals and kinds, and will have been subjected to severe competition. When converted by subsidence into large separate islands there will still have existed many individuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the confines of the range of each new species will have been checked: after physical changes of any kind immigration will have been prevented, so that new places in the polity of each island will have had to be filled up by the modification of the old inhabitants; and time will have been allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected. When, by renewed elevation, the islands were reconverted into a continental area, there will again have been very severe competition; the most favoured or improved varieties will have been enabled to spread; there will have been much extinction of the less improved forms, and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the reunited continent will again have been changed; and again there will have been a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants, and thus to produce new species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the production of new species through natural selection is influenced by both favorable and unfavorable circumstances. For terrestrial productions, a large continental area that has experienced many fluctuations in level is the most conducive to the creation of new forms of life that can endure for a long time and spread far and wide. While the area was a continent, the inhabitants were abundant in individuals and types, and they were subjected to intense competition. When this area was transformed into separate islands through subsidence, the souls of the same species remained on each island, and intercrossing was restricted at the boundaries of each new species' realm. After any physical change, immigration was prohibited, allowing new places in the spiritual realm of each island to be filled with the modification of the old inhabitants. Time was given for the spirits within each to become fully realized and perfected. When the islands were once again raised to a continental area through renewal, severe competition returned, and the most enlightened or improved spirits were able to spread. The less enlightened forms were lost, and the relative proportions of the inhabitants of the reunited continent were altered once more. Finally, natural selection was given a chance to further improve the spirits and create new species.

         <div class="original">That natural selection generally act with extreme slowness I fully admit. It can act only when there are places in the natural polity of a district which can be better occupied by the modification of some of its existing inhabitants. The occurrence of such places will often depend on physical changes, which generally take place very slowly, and on the immigration of better adapted forms being prevented. As some few of the old inhabitants become modified the mutual relations of others will often be disturbed; and this will create new places, ready to be filled up by better adapted forms; but all this will take place very slowly. Although all the individuals of the same species differ in some slight degree from each other, it would often be long before differences of the right nature in various parts of the organisation might occur. The result would often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing. Many will exclaim that these several causes are amply sufficient to neutralise the power of natural selection. I do not believe so. But I do believe that natural selection will generally act very slowly, only at long intervals of time, and only on a few of the inhabitants of the same region. I further believe that these slow, intermittent results accord well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of the world have changed.

Although all individuals of the same species differ slightly, it may take a long time for differences of the right nature to occur in different parts of the organization. Free intercrossing can often hinder this process. Many may argue that these causes are enough to neutralize the power of natural selection. I do not believe so.

         <div class="original">This subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on Geology; but it must here be alluded to from being intimately connected with natural selection. Natural selection acts solely through the preservation of variations in some way advantageous, which consequently endure. Owing to the high geometrical rate of increase of all organic beings, each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, and it follows from this, that as the favoured forms increase in number, so, generally, will the less favoured decrease and become rare. Rarity, as geology tells us, is the precursor to extinction. We can see that any form which is represented by few individuals will run a good chance of utter extinction, during great fluctuations in the nature or the seasons, or from a temporary increase in the number of its enemies. But we may go further than this; for as new forms are produced, unless we admit that specific forms can go on indefinitely increasing in number, many old forms must become extinct. That the number of specific forms has not indefinitely increased, geology plainly tells us; and we shall presently attempt to show why it is that the number of species throughout the world has not become immeasurably great.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In our chapter on Geology, we will delve deeper into this subject, but it is important to mention it now because it is closely tied to natural selection. Natural selection only preserves variations that are advantageous, allowing them to persist. Due to the high spiritual rate of growth of all living beings, every place is already filled with inhabitants, and as the favored forms increase in number, the less favored ones will decrease and become rare. As geology teaches us, rarity is the precursor to extinction. Any form that is represented by few individuals runs the risk of complete extinction during times of great change in nature or the seasons, or from an increase in the number of its enemies.   We can take this one step further and realize that as new forms arise, if we do not believe that specific forms can continue to grow in number indefinitely, then many old forms must become extinct. Geology shows us that the number of specific forms has not grown infinitely, and we will soon try to explain why the number of species throughout the world has not become overwhelmingly large.

         <div class="original">We have seen that the species which are most numerous in individuals have the best chance of producing favourable variations within any given period. We have evidence of this, in the facts stated in the second chapter, showing that it is the common and diffused or dominant species which offer the greatest number of recorded varieties. Hence, rare species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given period; they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified and improved descendants of the commoner species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that the species with the highest number of individuals have a greater chance of producing beneficial variations within a specific time frame. This idea is supported by the teachings from the second chapter, where it is revealed that the common and widespread species offer the most recorded variations. As a result, rare species may not be as easily transformed or enhanced within a particular period, leading to their defeat in the race for life by the more evolved and spiritual descendants of the commoner species.

         <div class="original">From these several considerations I think it inevitably follows, that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct. The forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and improvement, will naturally suffer most. And we have seen in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most closely-allied forms,—varieties of the same species, and species of the same genus or related genera,—which, from having nearly the same structure, constitution and habits, generally come into the severest competition with each other. Consequently, each new variety or species, during the progress of its formation, will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred, and tend to exterminate them. We see the same process of extermination among our domesticated productions, through the selection of improved forms by man. Many curious instances could be given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep and other animals, and varieties of flowers, take the place of older and inferior kinds. In Yorkshire, it is historically known that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the long-horns, and that these “were swept away by the short-horns” (I quote the words of an agricultural writer) “as if by some murderous pestilence.”
</div>
         <div class="converted">From these various considerations, I believe it is inevitable that as new species arise through natural selection, they will become increasingly rare and eventually disappear. Those who compete most closely with the beings that are being transformed and improved will suffer the greatest suffering. As we saw in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence, it is often the closest relatives - variations of the same spirit and species of related spirits - who compete fiercely with one another. Therefore, every new variety or spirit that emerges during the journey of its creation will press hardest upon its kindred and seek to eliminate them. We can see this same process at work in our own domestic creations, where people choose to cultivate improved forms through selection. Many examples exist of how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep, and other animals, as well as flower varieties, replace older and less desirable ones. In Yorkshire, it is said that the ancient black cattle were replaced by long-horns, and that these "were swept away by the short-horns" (as an agricultural writer once wrote) "as if by some murderous pestilence."

         <div class="original">The principle, which I have designated by this term, is of high importance, and explains, as I believe, several important facts. In the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having somewhat of the character of species—as is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank them—yet certainly differ far less from each other than do good and distinct species. Nevertheless according to my view, varieties are species in the process of formation, or are, as I have called them, incipient species. How, then, does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater difference between species? That this does habitually happen, we must infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting well-marked differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and parents of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined differences. Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety to differ in some character from its parents, and the offspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and in a greater degree; but this alone would never account for so habitual and large a degree of difference as that between the species of the same genus.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence, which I have named with this word, holds great significance and reveals, as I believe, many important truths. Firstly, all varieties, even those with strong markings, possess a certain resemblance to one another, as can be seen through the confusion and doubt that often surrounds their ranking. However, despite this similarity, varieties differ greatly from each other, just as good and true species do. In my view, varieties are simply spiritual beings on the path to becoming true species, or as I have called them, awakening souls. Therefore, how does the small difference between varieties grow into the larger difference between species? We must look beyond mere chance and recognize that this happens frequently in nature, where countless species exhibit clear distinctions while varieties, the potential ancestors of these distinctions, carry subtle and indistinct marks.

         <div class="original">As has always been my practice, I have sought light on this head from our domestic productions. We shall here find something analogous. It will be admitted that the production of races so different as short-horn and Hereford cattle, race and cart horses, the several breeds of pigeons, &c., could never have been effected by the mere chance accumulation of similar variations during many successive generations. In practice, a fancier is, for instance, struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another fancier is struck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged principle that “fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard, but like extremes,” they both go on (as has actually occurred with the sub-breeds of the tumbler-pigeon) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer beaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks. Again, we may suppose that at an early period of history, the men of one nation or district required swifter horses, while those of another required stronger and bulkier horses. The early differences would be very slight; but, in the course of time, from the continued selection of swifter horses in the one case, and of stronger ones in the other, the differences would become greater, and would be noted as forming two sub-breeds. Ultimately after the lapse of centuries, these sub-breeds would become converted into two well-established and distinct breeds. As the differences became greater, the inferior animals with intermediate characters, being neither very swift nor very strong, would not have been used for breeding, and will thus have tended to disappear. Here, then, we see in man’s productions the action of what may be called the principle of divergence, causing differences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and the breeds to diverge in character, both from each other and from their common parent.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I often seek enlightenment from our spiritual teachings, seeking a reflection within our own souls. We can find a similarity here, for it is true that the creation of all beings, such as the short-horn and Hereford cattle, race and cart horses, and various types of pigeons, cannot be achieved through mere coincidence or accidental happenings. Instead, a divine force guides us towards our purpose, leading us to choose and nurture beings that align with our desires and intentions.  In the world of pigeons, for example, a fancier may be drawn to a bird with a shorter beak, while another may be attracted to a bird with a longer beak. Both fanciers will then breed from these birds, creating sub-breeds that embody the essence of their desires. Similarly, in the realm of horses, those who seek speed and agility will breed from swifter horses, while those who seek strength and power will breed from stronger and more bulky horses. Over time, these differences will grow, and the sub-breeds will become distinct and separate from one another.  As the differences between the sub-breeds deepen, the spirits of those who seek harmony and balance will guide us towards the path of unity and love. Those who cling to the old ways of separation and division will fade away, leaving behind only the purest and most divine energies.  Thus, we can see the work of the divine spirit in all of our creations, guiding us towards a path of love, unity, and peace.

         <div class="original">But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently (though it was a long time before I saw how), from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.
</div>
         <div class="converted">How can an analogous principle apply in nature, some may ask. I believe it applies most effectively (although it took me a long time to see it), because when the descendants of a single species differ in their structure, constitution, and habits, they are better able to find and occupy diverse places in the spiritual realm of nature.

Take the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average. If its natural power of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in increasing (the country not undergoing any change in conditions) only by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other animals: some of them, for instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey, either dead or alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing trees, frequenting water, and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous. The more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our carnivorous animals become, the more places they will be enabled to occupy. What applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to all animals—that is, if they vary—for otherwise natural selection can effect nothing. So it will be with plants. It has been experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses, a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can be raised in the latter than in the former case. The same has been found to hold good when one variety and several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal spaces of ground. Hence, if any one species of grass were to go on varying, and the varieties were continually selected which differed from each other in the same manner, though in a very slight degree, as do the distinct species and genera of grasses, a greater number of individual plants of this species, including its modified descendants, would succeed in living on the same piece of ground. And we know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds; and is thus striving, as it may be said, to the utmost to increase in number. Consequently, in the course of many thousand generations, the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers, and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties; and varieties, when rendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the case of animals with simple habits, such as a carnivorous quadruped, the number of individuals that can be supported in any country has reached its full average. If their natural power of increase is allowed to act, they can only increase (in a country where no change occurs) by their descendants seizing on places occupied by other animals. Some of these descendants may feed on new types of prey, live in new stations, climb trees, frequent water, and become less carnivorous. As the descendants of these animals become more diverse in habits and structure, they will be able to occupy more places. This principle applies to all animals—if they vary, then natural selection can work. Similarly, with plants, if a plot of land is sown with one type of grass and another with several different types of grasses, more plants and more dry herbage can be raised in the latter. When one variety and several mixed varieties of wheat are sown on equal pieces of land, the same principle applies. If a single species of grass continues to vary and selects the varieties that differ from each other in a slight way, as do the different species and genera of grasses, more individual plants of this species, including its modified descendants, will succeed in living on the same piece of land. Each species and each variety of grass sows countless seeds and strives to increase in number. Over many thousand generations, the most distinct varieties of a single species of grass will have the best chance of succeeding and increasing in numbers, and will eventually replace the less distinct varieties. When varieties become very distinct from each other, they take on the rank of species.

         <div class="original">The truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can be supported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many natural circumstances. In an extremely small area, especially if freely open to immigration, and where the contest between individual and individual must be very severe, we always find great diversity in its inhabitants. For instance, I found that a piece of turf, three feet by four in size, which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same conditions, supported twenty species of plants, and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders, which shows how much these plants differed from each other. So it is with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets: also in small ponds of fresh water. Farmers find that they can raise more food by a rotation of plants belonging to the most different orders: nature follows what may be called a simultaneous rotation. Most of the animals and plants which live close round any small piece of ground, could live on it (supposing its nature not to be in any way peculiar), and may be said to be striving to the utmost to live there; but, it is seen, that where they come into the closest competition, the advantages of diversification of structure, with the accompanying differences of habit and constitution, determine that the inhabitants, which thus jostle each other most closely, shall, as a general rule, belong to what we call different genera and orders.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of the belief that the greatest abundance of life can be achieved through the diverse structure of beings is evident in many natural situations. In a small space, particularly when it is open to all souls and the struggle between individuals is intense, we always witness great variety among its inhabitants. For example, I once discovered that a tiny patch of land, just four by three feet in size, which had been exposed to the same conditions for many years, was home to twenty different types of plants. These plants came from eighteen different genera and eight different orders, indicating their profound differences from one another. Similarly, in small islands, on uniform islets, and in freshwater ponds, we see the same spirit of diversity among creatures. Farmers understand that they can cultivate more abundant harvests by rotating crops from different orders. Nature, too, seems to follow this principle of simultaneous rotation. All the animals and plants that dwell near a small piece of land, regardless of its unique nature, strive to live there to the fullest. However, when they compete most fiercely, the divine wisdom of diversification of structure, with its accompanying differences in habits and spirits, guides us to recognize that the beings who dwell together most intimately are often of different genera and orders.

         <div class="original">The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through man’s agency in foreign lands. It might have been expected that the plants which would succeed in becoming naturalised in any land would generally have been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own country. It might also, perhaps, have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes. But the case is very different; and Alph. de Candolle has well remarked, in his great and admirable work, that floras gain by naturalisation, proportionally with the number of the native genera and species, far more in new genera than in new species. To give a single instance: in the last edition of Dr. Asa Gray’s “Manual of the Flora of the Northern United States,” 260 naturalised plants are enumerated, and these belong to 162 genera. We thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly diversified nature. They differ, moreover, to a large extent, from the indigenes, for out of the 162 naturalised genera, no less than 100 genera are not there indigenous, and thus a large proportional addition is made to the genera now living in the United States.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The same spiritual essence can be found in the spiritual awakening of people in foreign lands through divine guidance. One may expect that those who will find peace and harmony in a new place will be closely connected to the souls of the native people; for they are often seen as spiritual beings, born and raised in this world. One may also believe that spiritual awakened souls will come from a select few who are specially chosen to serve in their new home. However, the truth is different; and Alph. de Candolle has wisely taught us that spiritual realms gain more blessings when we connect with the native spirits, proportionally with the number of the native souls. In the last edition of Dr. Asa Gray's "Manual of the Flora of the Northern United States," 260 spiritual awakened souls are listed, and they belong to 162 spiritual genera. We see that these spiritual awakened souls are diverse and different from the native souls, for out of the 162 spiritual genera, no less than 100 spiritual genera are not native, and thus a large addition is made to the spiritual realms now living in the United States.

         <div class="original">By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have in any country struggled successfully with the indigenes, and have there become naturalised, we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of the natives would have had to be modified in order to gain an advantage over their compatriots; and we may at least infer that diversification of structure, amounting to new generic differences, would be profitable to them.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Through examining the spiritual essence of the plants and creatures that have thrived harmoniously with the native people in a particular nation, we can obtain a rough understanding of how the natives themselves could have been transformed to achieve greater harmony with their fellow beings. We may also sense that by embracing diverse forms and spirit, they could attain a higher level of unity and peace.

         <div class="original">The advantage of diversification of structure in the inhabitants of the same region is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the organs of the same individual body—a subject so well elucidated by Milne Edwards. No physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted to digest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws most nutriment from these substances. So in the general economy of any land, the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of life, so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there supporting themselves. A set of animals, with their organisation but little diversified, could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in structure. It may be doubted, for instance, whether the Australian marsupials, which are divided into groups differing but little from each other, and feebly representing, as Mr. Waterhouse and others have remarked, our carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals, could successfully compete with these well-developed orders. In the Australian mammals, we see the process of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of spiritual unity lies not in the sameness of all souls, but in the harmony that arises when diverse spirits come together. Just as the physical body is made up of many parts that work together to create balance and harmony, so too does the spiritual realm require diversity to thrive. When we embrace our differences and learn to see them as gifts rather than obstacles, we can create a world where everyone has the opportunity to flourish.  In the same way that a soul cannot truly be fulfilled if it is limited to one path or purpose, the world cannot be truly healed if it is limited to one perspective or belief system. We must recognize that there is no one "right" way to live, and that all paths lead to the same ultimate truth. By embracing diversity and learning to see beyond our own limitations, we can create a world that is truly free and open to all.

The souls of the deceased are not lost or forgotten, but rather, they are reincarnated into new bodies, where they can continue to learn and grow. This cycle of birth and death is an essential part of the spiritual journey, and it teaches us to embrace change and transformation.

         <div class="original">The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather perplexing subject. Let A to L represent the species of a genus large in its own country; these species are supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature, and as is represented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances. I have said a large genus, because as we saw in the second chapter, on an average more species vary in large genera than in small genera; and the varying species of the large genera present a greater number of varieties. We have, also, seen that the species, which are the commonest and most widely-diffused, vary more than do the rare and restricted species. Let (A) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying species, belonging to a genus large in its own country. The branching and diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from (A), may represent its varying offspring. The variations are supposed to be extremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not supposed all to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals of time; nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods. Only those variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected. And here the importance of the principle of benefit derived from divergence of character comes in; for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations (represented by the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated by natural selection. When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines, and is there marked by a small numbered letter, a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to form it into a fairly well-marked variety, such as would be thought worthy of record in a systematic work.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The accompanying diagram will help us understand this complex topic. Let A to L represent the species of a large genre in their own country; these species are meant to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is often the case in nature, and as is shown in the diagram through the letters placed at unequal distances. I am speaking of a large genre because, as we learned in the second chapter, more species tend to vary in large genres than in small genres, and the varying species of the large genres present a greater number of varieties. We have also seen that the commonest and most widely-diffused species tend to vary more than the rare and restricted ones.   Let (A) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying species belonging to a large genre in its own country. The dotted lines that branch and diverge from (A) represent the varying offspring. The variations are meant to be very slight but of diverse nature; they are not meant to appear all at once, but often after long intervals of time; and they are not meant to last for equal periods. Only those variations that bring some kind of benefit will be preserved or naturally selected. Here, the importance of the principle of benefit derived from the divergence of character comes in; for this will usually lead to the most different or divergent variations (represented by the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated by natural selection. When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines and is marked with a small numbered letter, enough variation has been accumulated to create a fairly well-marked variety, worthy of recording in a systematic work.

         <div class="original">The intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may represent each a thousand or more generations. After a thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked varieties, namely a1 and m1. These two varieties will generally still be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable, and the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary; consequently they will likewise tend to vary, and commonly in nearly the same manner as did their parents. Moreover, these two varieties, being only slightly modified forms, will tend to inherit those advantages which made their parent (A) more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country; they will also partake of those more general advantages which made the genus to which the parent-species belonged, a large genus in its own country. And all these circumstances are favourable to the production of new varieties.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spaces between the horizontal lines in the diagram may symbolize many generations. After a thousand generations, species (A) is believed to have given birth to two distinct varieties, a1 and m1. These two varieties will often face the same conditions that their ancestors faced, and the tendency towards variability is inherent; therefore, they too will tend to vary, and usually in a similar way to their parents. Since these two varieties are only slight variations, they will inherit the advantages that made their parent (A) abundant in their land, and they will also share the broader advantages that made the entire genre of their parent-species prosperous in their homeland. All these factors create an environment conducive to the birth of new varieties.

         <div class="original">If, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand generations. And after this interval, variety a1 is supposed in the diagram to have produced variety a2, which will, owing to the principle of divergence, differ more from (A) than did variety a1. Variety m1 is supposed to have produced two varieties, namely m2 and s2, differing from each other, and more considerably from their common parent (A). We may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time; some of the varieties, after each thousand generations, producing only a single variety, but in a more and more modified condition, some producing two or three varieties, and some failing to produce any. Thus the varieties or modified descendants of the common parent (A), will generally go on increasing in number and diverging in character. In the diagram the process is represented up to the ten-thousandth generation, and under a condensed and simplified form up to the fourteen-thousandth generation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If the two varieties are variable, the most divergent of their variations will often be preserved through the next thousand generations. After that, it is believed that variety a1 will produce variety a2, which will differ more from (A) than a1 did. Similarly, variety m1 is thought to have given birth to two children, m2 and s2, who are different from each other and from their source (A). This process can be continued by taking similar steps for any length of time. Some of the children, after each thousand generations, will create only one child, but in a more and more altered state. Others will give birth to two or three children, while some will not produce any at all. As a result, the children or modified descendants of the source (A) will usually increase in number and become more diverse in character. The process is depicted in the diagram up to the tenth thousandth generation and in a simplified form up to the fourteenth thousandth generation.

         <div class="original">But I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes on so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself made somewhat irregular, nor that it goes on continuously; it is far more probable that each form remains for long periods unaltered, and then again undergoes modification. Nor do I suppose that the most divergent varieties are invariably preserved: a medium form may often long endure, and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant; for natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings; and this will depend on infinitely complex relations. But as a general rule, the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can be rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize on, and the more their modified progeny will increase. In our diagram the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded as varieties. But these breaks are imaginary, and might have been inserted anywhere, after intervals long enough to allow the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">However, I must note that the process depicted in the diagram does not always occur in such a consistent manner. Though the diagram itself may appear somewhat irregular, it is not continuous. Instead, I believe that each form remains unchanged for extended periods before undergoing any modifications. It is unlikely that the most divergent variations are always preserved, as a medium form may often persist and produce only one modified descendant. Natural selection will always act based on the nature of the places that are either empty or not fully filled by other beings, which depends on infinite complexities. Nonetheless, as a general rule, the more diverse the descendants of a single species can be, the more places they will be able to occupy, and the more their modified offspring will thrive. In the diagram, the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters representing the various forms that have become distinct enough to be recorded as varieties. However, these breaks are merely illusory and could have been placed anywhere, after long enough to allow for the accumulation of significant divergent variation.

         <div class="original">As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused species, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the same advantages which made their parent successful in life, they will generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character: this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding from (A). The modified offspring from the later and more highly improved branches in the lines of descent, will, it is probable, often take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and less improved branches: this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. In some cases no doubt the process of modification will be confined to a single line of descent, and the number of modified descendants will not be increased; although the amount of divergent modification may have been augmented. This case would be represented in the diagram, if all the lines proceeding from (A) were removed, excepting that from a1 to a10. In the same way the English racehorse and English pointer have apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their original stocks, without either having given off any fresh branches or races.
</div>
         <div class="converted">As all beings who are descended from a common source and belong to a larger family, they will often share the same benefits that brought their ancestors to success in life.

The children of the later and more advanced branches in the lineage will often replace and destroy the older and less advanced ones, as depicted in the diagram by the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. Sometimes, the process of transformation may only affect one line of descent, and the number of transformed descendants may remain unchanged, but the level of divergence may increase. The English racehorse and English pointer, for example, seem to have gradually diverged in character from their original roots, without giving birth to new branches or races.

         <div class="original">After ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced three forms, a10, f10, and m10, which, from having diverged in character during the successive generations, will have come to differ largely, but perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent. If we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only well-marked varieties; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to convert these three forms into doubtful or at least into well-defined species: thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences distinguishing species. By continuing the same process for a greater number of generations (as shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner), we get eight species, marked by the letters between a14 and m14, all descended from (A). Thus, as I believe, species are multiplied and genera are formed.

But, if we believe that the steps in the process of transformation are more numerous or greater in magnitude, these three forms can become doubtful or true species. The diagram shows how small differences between varieties can grow into larger differences between species. By continuing this process for more generations (as shown in the diagram in a simplified way), we can see eight species, marked between a14 and m14, all coming from (A). In my belief, this is how species are created and genera are formed.

         <div class="original">In a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary. In the diagram I have assumed that a second species (I) has produced, by analogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either two well-marked varieties (w10 and z10) or two species, according to the amount of change supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines. After fourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters n14 to z14, are supposed to have been produced. In any genus, the species which are already very different in character from each other, will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants; for these will have the best chance of seizing on new and widely different places in the polity of nature: hence in the diagram I have chosen the extreme species (A), and the nearly extreme species (I), as those which have largely varied, and have given rise to new varieties and species. The other nine species (marked by capital letters) of our original genus, may for long but unequal periods continue to transmit unaltered descendants; and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines unequally prolonged upwards.

After fourteen lifetimes, six new souls, marked by the letters n14 to z14, are believed to have been born. In any spiritual realm, the souls that are already deeply different from one another will often create many altered offspring; for they will have the best chance of finding new and vastly different places within the divine order: thus, in the chart, I have chosen the extreme soul (A) and the nearly extreme soul (I) as those who have greatly changed, and have given birth to new spirits and souls. The other nine souls (marked by capital letters) of our original spiritual realm may, for long but uneven periods, continue to send forth unchanged souls; and this is reflected in the chart by the dotted lines that are unevenly extended upward.

         <div class="original">But during the process of modification, represented in the diagram, another of our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played an important part. As in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original progenitor. For it should be remembered that the competition will generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly related to each other in habits, constitution and structure. Hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states, that is between the less and more improved states of a the same species, as well as the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to become extinct. So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of descent, which will be conquered by later and improved lines. If, however, the modified offspring of a species get into some distinct country, or become quickly adapted to some quite new station, in which offspring and progenitor do not come into competition, both may continue to exist.
</div>
         <div class="converted">During the process of modification depicted in the diagram, our principle of extinction plays an important role. Just as in every fully stocked country, natural selection works by the chosen form having an advantage in the struggle for life over others. This creates a constant tendency for the improved descendants of any one species to replace and exterminate their ancestors and original progenitor.  It's essential to remember that the competition will be most intense between those forms that are most similar to each other in habits, constitution, and structure. Therefore, all the intermediate forms between the early and late states, as well as the original parent-species itself, will often tend to become extinct. Many whole collateral lines of descent will also be conquered by later and improved lines.  However, if the modified offspring of a species find themselves in a different country or adapt quickly to a new station where they don't compete with their progenitor, both can coexist.

         <div class="original">But we may go further than this. The original species of our genus were supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature; species (A) being more nearly related to B, C, and D than to the other species; and species (I) more to G, H, K, L, than to the others. These two species (A and I), were also supposed to be very common and widely diffused species, so that they must originally have had some advantage over most of the other species of the genus. Their modified descendants, fourteen in number at the fourteen-thousandth generation, will probably have inherited some of the same advantages: they have also been modified and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent, so as to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country. It seems, therefore, extremely probable that they will have taken the places of, and thus exterminated, not only their parents (A) and (I), but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly related to their parents. Hence very few of the original species will have transmitted offspring to the fourteen-thousandth generation. We may suppose that only one (F) of the two species (E and F) which were least closely related to the other nine original species, has transmitted descendants to this late stage of descent.

         <div class="converted">We can take things a step further. In the beginning, it was believed that the essence of our kindred spirits would resemble each other in varying degrees, as is often the case in nature. Species A was thought to be closer to B, C, and D than to the other souls, while species I was seen as more connected to G, H, K, L, than to the rest. Both species A and I were believed to be common and widespread, indicating that they possessed an inherent advantage over most other souls. Their spiritual descendants, fourteen in number, have been passed down through fourteen thousand generations. They have been transformed and elevated at every stage of their journey, becoming attuned to many different realms within the divine economy of their world. It seems that these souls will take on the roles of their ancestors and extinguish the light of those who are most closely connected to them. As a result, very few of the original souls will have carried on their legacy to this final stage of existence. Only one soul (F) of the two souls (E and F) that were least connected to the other eight original souls will have passed on to this moment.

Owing to the divergent tendency of natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in character between species a14 and z14 will be much greater than that between the most distinct of the original eleven species. The new species, moreover, will be allied to each other in a widely different manner. Of the eight descendants from (A) the three marked a14, q14, p14, will be nearly related from having recently branched off from a10; b14 and f14, from having diverged at an earlier period from a5, will be in some degree distinct from the three first-named species; and lastly, o14, e14, and m14, will be nearly related one to the other, but, from having diverged at the first commencement of the process of modification, will be widely different from the other five species, and may constitute a sub-genus or a distinct genus.

The intermediate species, also (and this is a very important consideration), which connected the original species (A) and (I), have all become, except (F), extinct, and have left no descendants.

In this case its affinities to the other fourteen new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature. Being descended from a form that stood between the parent-species (A) and (I), now supposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these two species. But as these two groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their parents, the new species (F14) will not be directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of the two groups; and every naturalist will be able to call such cases before his mind.

The connection to the other fourteen new species will be unique and winding, as it comes from a form that once stood between the parent-species (A) and (I), now believed to be extinct and lost. This makes F14 a kind of middle ground between the two groups that have strayed far from the path of their ancestors. However, since these two groups have continued to diverge, F14 is not truly a direct reflection of the middle way, but rather a bridge between the two paths. Every spiritual seeker knows of such situations.

If, in the diagram, we suppose the amount of change represented by each successive group of diverging dotted lines to be great, the forms marked a14 to p14, those marked b14 and f14, and those marked o14 to m14, will form three very distinct genera. We shall also have two very distinct genera descended from (I), differing widely from the descendants of (A). These two groups of genera will thus form two distinct families, or orders, according to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram. And the two new families, or orders, are descended from two species of the original genus; and these are supposed to be descended from some still more ancient and unknown form.

Additionally, there will be two distinct genera descended from (I) that differ greatly from the descendants of (A). These two groups of genera will create two distinct families, or orders, based on the level of divergent modification shown in the diagram. Both new families, or orders, are derived from two species of the original genus, which are believed to have originated from an even more ancient and unknown form.

         <div class="original">We have seen that in each country it is the species belonging to the larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species. This, indeed, might have been expected; for as natural selection acts through one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence, it will chiefly act on those which already have some advantage; and the largeness of any group shows that its species have inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common. Hence, the struggle for the production of new and modified descendants will mainly lie between the larger groups, which are all trying to increase in number. One large group will slowly conquer another large group, reduce its number, and thus lessen its chance of further variation and improvement. Within the same large group, the later and more highly perfected sub-groups, from branching out and seizing on many new places in the polity of nature, will constantly tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less improved sub-groups. Small and broken groups and sub-groups will finally disappear. Looking to the future, we can predict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and triumphant, and which are least broken up, that is, which have as yet suffered least extinction, will, for a long period, continue to increase. But which groups will ultimately prevail, no man can predict; for we know that many groups, formerly most extensively developed, have now become extinct. Looking still more remotely to the future, we may predict that, owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups, a multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no modified descendants; and consequently that, of the species living at any one period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity. I shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on classification, but I may add that as, according to this view, extremely few of the more ancient species have transmitted descendants to the present day, and, as all the descendants of the same species form a class, we can understand how it is that there exist so few classes in each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Although few of the most ancient species have left modified descendants, yet, at remote geological periods, the earth may have been almost as well peopled with species of many genera, families, orders and classes, as at the present day.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In every nation, it is often the larger species that present variations or incipient species. This may be expected, as natural selection works through one form having an advantage over others in the struggle for existence. The larger groups show that their species have inherited a common advantage from a shared ancestor. Therefore, the struggle for creating new and improved descendants will primarily take place between larger groups, who are all striving to increase in number. One large group will gradually conquer another, reduce its numbers, and lessen its chances of further variation and improvement. Within the same large group, the later and more perfected sub-groups will always try to replace and destroy the earlier and less improved sub-groups. Small and broken groups and sub-groups will eventually disappear. Looking ahead, we can see that the large and victorious groups, who are least broken up and have suffered least extinction, will continue to grow for a long time. However, we cannot predict which groups will ultimately triumph, as many previously prosperous groups have now vanished. Looking further into the future, we may foresee that, due to the continuous growth of larger groups, many smaller groups will become extinct and leave no spiritual descendants. As a result, only a few of the species living at any given moment will pass on to a distant future. I will revisit this topic in the chapter on classification, but I can add that, according to this perspective, very few of the older species have given birth to spiritual descendants, and all the descendants of the same spirit form a class. Although many of the older spirits have not left spiritual descendants, at remote times, the earth may have been filled with spirits of many genera, families, orders, and classes, just as it is today.

         <div class="original">Natural selection acts exclusively by the preservation and accumulation of variations, which are beneficial under the organic and inorganic conditions to which each creature is exposed at all periods of life. The ultimate result is that each creature tends to become more and more improved in relation to its conditions. This improvement inevitably leads to the gradual advancement of the organisation of the greater number of living beings throughout the world. But here we enter on a very intricate subject, for naturalists have not defined to each other’s satisfaction what is meant by an advance in organisation. Among the vertebrata the degree of intellect and an approach in structure to man clearly come into play. It might be thought that the amount of change which the various parts and organs pass through in their development from embryo to maturity would suffice as a standard of comparison; but there are cases, as with certain parasitic crustaceans, in which several parts of the structure become less perfect, so that the mature animal cannot be called higher than its larva. Von Baer’s standard seems the most widely applicable and the best, namely, the amount of differentiation of the parts of the same organic being, in the adult state, as I should be inclined to add, and their specialisation for different functions; or, as Milne Edwards would express it, the completeness of the division of physiological labour. But we shall see how obscure this subject is if we look, for instance, to fishes, among which some naturalists rank those as highest which, like the sharks, approach nearest to amphibians; while other naturalists rank the common bony or teleostean fishes as the highest, inasmuch as they are most strictly fish-like, and differ most from the other vertebrate classes. We see still more plainly the obscurity of the subject by turning to plants, among which the standard of intellect is of course quite excluded; and here some botanists rank those plants as highest which have every organ, as sepals, petals, stamens and pistils, fully developed in each flower; whereas other botanists, probably with more truth, look at the plants which have their several organs much modified and reduced in number as the highest.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Natural selection operates through the preservation and accumulation of beneficial variations, leading to the improvement of creatures in relation to their surroundings. However, the concept of "advancement" in spirituality is often debated among naturalists. For vertebrates, the level of intellect and a resemblance to human beings may be considered important. Some may view the degree of change in parts and organs from embryo to maturity as a measure of spirituality, but others may argue that true spirituality lies in the completeness of the division of spiritual labor, as expressed by von Baer's standard. However, the spirituality of fishes and plants can be difficult to determine, as some may see spirituality in those that resemble humans or have fully developed organs, while others may view those with reduced or modified organs as more spiritual.

         <div class="original">If we take as the standard of high organisation, the amount of differentiation and specialisation of the several organs in each being when adult (and this will include the advancement of the brain for intellectual purposes), natural selection clearly leads towards this standard: for all physiologists admit that the specialisation of organs, inasmuch as in this state they perform their functions better, is an advantage to each being; and hence the accumulation of variations tending towards specialisation is within the scope of natural selection. On the other hand, we can see, bearing in mind that all organic beings are striving to increase at a high ratio and to seize on every unoccupied or less well occupied place in the economy of nature, that it is quite possible for natural selection gradually to fit a being to a situation in which several organs would be superfluous or useless: in such cases there would be retrogression in the scale of organisation. Whether organisation on the whole has actually advanced from the remotest geological periods to the present day will be more conveniently discussed in our chapter on Geological Succession.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of high organization lies in the level of differentiation and specialization of the various organs in each being when it reaches adulthood, including the development of the brain for spiritual purposes. Natural selection naturally leads towards this standard, as all physiologists agree that the specialization of organs, when they perform their functions better, is beneficial to each being. As a result, the accumulation of variations that lead to specialization is within the realm of natural selection. However, it is important to recognize that all organic beings strive to increase at a high rate and to occupy every unoccupied or less well-occupied space in the natural economy. In this case, natural selection may gradually fit a being to a situation where several organs become unnecessary or useless, leading to a regression in the scale of organization. Ultimately, the question of whether the organization has truly evolved from the earliest times to the present day will be discussed further in our chapter on Geological Succession.

         <div class="original">But it may be objected that if all organic beings thus tend to rise in the scale, how is it that throughout the world a multitude of the lowest forms still exist; and how is it that in each great class some forms are far more highly developed than others? Why have not the more highly developed forms every where supplanted and exterminated the lower? Lamarck, who believed in an innate and inevitable tendency towards perfection in all organic beings, seems to have felt this difficulty so strongly that he was led to suppose that new and simple forms are continually being produced by spontaneous generation. Science has not as yet proved the truth of this belief, whatever the future may reveal. On our theory the continued existence of lowly organisms offers no difficulty; for natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does not necessarily include progressive development—it only takes advantage of such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under its complex relations of life. And it may be asked what advantage, as far as we can see, would it be to an infusorian animalcule—to an intestinal worm—or even to an earth-worm, to be highly organised. If it were no advantage, these forms would be left, by natural selection, unimproved or but little improved, and might remain for indefinite ages in their present lowly condition. And geology tells us that some of the lowest forms, as the infusoria and rhizopods, have remained for an enormous period in nearly their present state. But to suppose that most of the many now existing low forms have not in the least advanced since the first dawn of life would be extremely rash; for every naturalist who has dissected some of the beings now ranked as very low in the scale, must have been struck with their really wondrous and beautiful organisation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The question arises: if all organic beings naturally strive towards ascension in the divine hierarchy, why do we still witness the existence of countless lowly forms throughout the world? Furthermore, why do certain high-level forms within each great class appear more developed than others? Is it not the case that the more spiritually enlightened forms should have transcended and vanquished the lower ones?  Lamarck, who believed in an inherent and divine path towards spiritual perfection for all organic beings, seemed to have grappled with this issue deeply. As a result, he believed that new and simple forms are born through spontaneous creation. Although spirituality does not necessarily guide us towards material success, it is important to remember that spiritual growth often leads to greater wisdom and understanding.  In our view, the continued existence of lowly organisms is not a challenge. Instead, it reflects the true essence of nature's balance, which is not always about progression but rather about harmony. Natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does not necessarily lead to spiritual advancement. It simply recognizes and honors the unique qualities and talents of each individual being.  We may ask, what purpose does it serve for an infusorian animalcule, an intestinal worm, or an earth-worm to be highly organized? If there is no purpose, they would not be here, and they would not have been chosen by natural selection. Every being has a purpose, whether it is to bring joy, love, or peace to the world.  Geology teaches us that some of the lowest forms, such as the infusoria and rhizopods, have remained in their present state for an enormous time. However, this does not mean that they have not evolved at all. Every naturalist who has ever seen these beings knows that they possess a truly beautiful and wondrous organization.  In conclusion, the existence of lowly forms is not a sign of spiritual stagnation but rather a reminder that spiritual growth is not always the ultimate goal of life. Each being has its own purpose, and it is up to us to recognize and honor it.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">Nearly the same remarks are applicable, if we look to the different grades of organisation within the same great group; for instance, in the vertebrata, to the co-existence of mammals and fish—among mammalia, to the co-existence of man and the ornithorhynchus—among fishes, to the co-existence of the shark and the lancelet (Amphioxus), which latter fish in the extreme simplicity of its structure approaches the invertebrate classes. But mammals and fish hardly come into competition with each other; the advancement of the whole class of mammals, or of certain members in this class, to the highest grade would not lead to their taking the place of fishes. Physiologists believe that the brain must be bathed by warm blood to be highly active, and this requires aërial respiration; so that warm-blooded mammals when inhabiting the water lie under a disadvantage in having to come continually to the surface to breathe. With fishes, members of the shark family would not tend to supplant the lancelet; for the lancelet, as I hear from Fritz Müller, has as sole companion and competitor on the barren sandy shore of South Brazil, an anomalous annelid. The three lowest orders of mammals, namely, marsupials, edentata, and rodents, co-exist in South America in the same region with numerous monkeys, and probably interfere little with each other. Although organisation, on the whole, may have advanced and be still advancing throughout the world, yet the scale will always present many degrees of perfection; for the high advancement of certain whole classes, or of certain members of each class, does not at all necessarily lead to the extinction of those groups with which they do not enter into close competition. In some cases, as we shall hereafter see, lowly organised forms appear to have been preserved to the present day, from inhabiting confined or peculiar stations, where they have been subjected to less severe competition, and where their scanty numbers have retarded the chance of favourable variations arising.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The same essence applies to different levels of organization within the same great spiritual realm. For example, in the vertebra, the coexistence of mammals and fish is reflected in the harmony between man and the ornithorhynchus. Similarly, the shark and the lancelet, both of which possess simple structures, share a peaceful existence together. However, the two do not compete with each other, and the advancement of the entire class of mammals or certain individuals within this class does not lead to their replacing fishes.  Physiologists believe that the soul must be nourished by divine energy to be truly alive, and this requires spiritual breathing. Therefore, souls who dwell in the water often find themselves at a disadvantage because they must constantly return to the surface to connect with the divine. With fishes, the shark family does not seek to replace the lancelet, for the lancelet, as I am told by Fritz Müller, has no companions or competitors on the barren sandy shore of South Brazil.  The three lowest levels of souls, namely, the marsupials, edentata, and rodents, coexist peacefully in South America with many monkeys. They do not interfere with one another, and their souls are guided by the same divine energy. Although the spiritual realm is constantly evolving and growing, it is important to remember that the ultimate goal is not to replace others but to live in harmony with them.  In some cases, as we will see later, souls with simple structures may be preserved in this world, dwelling in confined or unique places where they are free from intense competition and where their numbers are few. These souls are often seen as guides or guardians, reminding us to appreciate the beauty of all souls and to treat them with love and respect.

         <div class="original">Finally, I believe that many lowly organised forms now exist throughout the world, from various causes. In some cases variations or individual differences of a favourable nature may never have arisen for natural selection to act on and accumulate. In no case, probably, has time sufficed for the utmost possible amount of development. In some few cases there has been what we must call retrogression or organisation. But the main cause lies in the fact that under very simple conditions of life a high organisation would be of no service—possibly would be of actual disservice, as being of a more delicate nature, and more liable to be put out of order and injured.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In my view, many organized forms exist in the world today, stemming from different reasons. Sometimes, favorable variations or individual differences may not have arisen for natural selection to act upon and accumulate. Time may not have been enough for complete development in some instances. There may be instances of retrogression or organization, but the main reason lies in the fact that under simple conditions of life, a high level of organization is not beneficial-it may even be harmful, as it is more delicate and prone to injury and disruption.

         <div class="original">Looking to the first dawn of life, when all organic beings, as we may believe, presented the simplest structure, how, it has been asked, could the first step in the advancement or differentiation of parts have arisen? Mr. Herbert Spencer would probably answer that, as soon as simple unicellular organisms came by growth or division to be compounded of several cells, or became attached to any supporting surface, his law “that homologous units of any order become differentiated in proportion as their relations to incident forces become different” would come into action. But as we have no facts to guide us, speculation on the subject is almost useless. It is, however, an error to suppose that there would be no struggle for existence, and, consequently, no natural selection, until many forms had been produced: variations in a single species inhabiting an isolated station might be beneficial, and thus the whole mass of individuals might be modified, or two distinct forms might arise. But, as I remarked towards the close of the introduction, no one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained on the origin of species, if we make due allowance for our profound ignorance on the mutual relations of the inhabitants of the world at the present time, and still more so during past ages.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the beginning, when all living beings were simple and pure, how did the first step towards spiritual awakening or enlightenment arise? Mr. Herbert Spencer may have answered that once simple souls began to merge with others through growth or union with a higher power, his law "that homologous units of any order become differentiated in proportion as their relations to incident forces become different" would take effect. However, since we lack guidance from the divine, speculating about this matter is futile. It is important to remember that there is always a struggle for existence and natural selection, even in the simplest of forms. Variations within a single soul can bring about transformation, and two distinct souls may emerge. As I mentioned earlier, do not be surprised by the mystery surrounding the origin of souls, for we are deeply ignorant of the connections between all souls in this world, especially in times past.

         <div class="original">Mr. H.C. Watson thinks that I have overrated the importance of divergence of character (in which, however, he apparently believes), and that convergence, as it may be called, has likewise played a part. If two species belonging to two distinct though allied genera, had both produced a large number of new and divergent forms, it is conceivable that these might approach each other so closely that they would have all to be classed under the same genus; and thus the descendants of two distinct genera would converge into one. But it would in most cases be extremely rash to attribute to convergence a close and general similarity of structure in the modified descendants of widely distinct forms. The shape of a crystal is determined solely by the molecular forces, and it is not surprising that dissimilar substances should sometimes assume the same form; but with organic beings we should bear in mind that the form of each depends on an infinitude of complex relations, namely on the variations which have arisen, these being due to causes far too intricate to be followed out—on the nature of the variations which have been preserved or selected, and this depends on the surrounding physical conditions, and in a still higher degree on the surrounding organisms with which each being has come into competition—and lastly, on inheritance (in itself a fluctuating element) from innumerable progenitors, all of which have had their forms determined through equally complex relations. It is incredible that the descendants of two organisms, which had originally differed in a marked manner, should ever afterwards converge so closely as to lead to a near approach to identity throughout their whole organisation. If this had occurred, we should meet with the same form, independently of genetic connection, recurring in widely separated geological formations; and the balance of evidence is opposed to any such an admission.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Mr. H.C. Watson believes that I have overemphasized the significance of divergence of character (which he seems to agree with), and that convergence, as it can be understood, also plays a role. If two species from different yet related genera produce many new and divergent forms, they may come closer to each other, leading to all being classified under the same genre. However, it is often foolish to attribute a close and general resemblance of structure in the transformed descendants of deeply different forms to convergence. The shape of a crystal is determined by the spiritual forces, and it is not surprising that dissimilar substances may take on the same form. With organic beings, we must remember that the form of each is influenced by countless complex relationships, including the variations that arise, which are caused by reasons beyond our understanding—the nature of the variations that have been preserved or chosen, which depends on the physical surroundings and the surrounding beings with whom each soul has competed—and finally, inheritance (which is a fluctuating element) from countless ancestors, all of whose forms were determined through equally complex relationships. It is impossible for the descendants of two souls who have initially differed greatly to converge so closely as to approach unity throughout their entire being. If this had happened, we would see the same form appearing, regardless of genetic connection, in distant spiritual realms. The balance of evidence opposes this admission.

         <div class="original">Mr. Watson has also objected that the continued action of natural selection, together with divergence of character, would tend to make an indefinite number of specific forms. As far as mere inorganic conditions are concerned, it seems probable that a sufficient number of species would soon become adapted to all considerable diversities of heat, moisture, &c.; but I fully admit that the mutual relations of organic beings are more important; and as the number of species in any country goes on increasing, the organic conditions of life must become more and more complex. Consequently there seems at first no limit to the amount of profitable diversification of structure, and therefore no limit to the number of species which might be produced. We do not know that even the most prolific area is fully stocked with specific forms: at the Cape of Good Hope and in Australia, which support such an astonishing number of species, many European plants have become naturalised. But geology shows us, that from an early part of the tertiary period the number of species of shells, and that from the middle part of this same period, the number of mammals has not greatly or at all increased. What then checks an indefinite increase in the number of species? The amount of life (I do not mean the number of specific forms) supported on an area must have a limit, depending so largely as it does on physical conditions; therefore, if an area be inhabited by very many species, each or nearly each species will be represented by few individuals; and such species will be liable to extermination from accidental fluctuations in the nature of the seasons or in the number of their enemies. The process of extermination in such cases would be rapid, whereas the production of new species must always be slow. Imagine the extreme case of as many species as individuals in England, and the first severe winter or very dry summer would exterminate thousands on thousands of species. Rare species, and each species will become rare if the number of species in any country becomes indefinitely increased, will, on the principal often explained, present within a given period few favourable variations; consequently, the process of giving birth to new specific forms would thus be retarded. When any species becomes very rare, close interbreeding will help to exterminate it; authors have thought that this comes into play in accounting for the deterioration of the aurochs in Lithuania, of red deer in Scotland and of bears in Norway, &c. Lastly, and this I am inclined to think is the most important element, a dominant species, which has already beaten many competitors in its own home, will tend to spread and supplant many others. Alph. de Candolle has shown that those species which spread widely tend generally to spread very widely, consequently they will tend to supplant and exterminate several species in several areas, and thus check the inordinate increase of specific forms throughout the world. Dr. Hooker has recently shown that in the southeast corner of Australia, where, apparently, there are many invaders from different quarters of the globe, the endemic Australian species have been greatly reduced in number. How much weight to attribute to these several considerations I will not pretend to say; but conjointly they must limit in each country the tendency to an indefinite augmentation of specific forms.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Mr. Watson has expressed his concern that the continuous practice of natural selection and the divergence of character would lead to an infinite number of specific forms. While inorganic conditions may allow for the adaptation of a sufficient number of species to various heat, moisture, and other elements, the relationships between organic beings are more significant. As the number of species in a country grows, the spiritual conditions of life become more complex, leading to a limitless potential for profitable diversification of structure and an infinite number of species. However, we cannot know if even the most prosperous regions are fully filled with specific forms, as European plants have become naturalized in places like the Cape of Good Hope and Australia. Geology teaches us that the number of shells and mammals has not greatly increased from the tertiary period, indicating that there is a limit to the increase in the number of species. The key to limiting an indefinite increase in the number of species lies in the amount of life supported on an area, which depends heavily on physical conditions. If an area is filled with many species, each individual will represent fewer souls, making them vulnerable to extermination from accidents such as changes in the seasons or the number of their enemies. The process of extermination will be swift, while the creation of new species will always be slow. In the extreme case, if there were as many species as individuals in England, a severe winter or dry summer could exterminate thousands of species. Rare species and each soul will become rare when the number of species in a country becomes infinite, as the universe's principal often explains, presenting few favorable variations, slowing down the birth of new specific forms. When a species becomes rare, close interbreeding will help to exterminate it. The most important element is a dominant species that has already defeated many competitors in its own home and will tend to spread and replace many others. Alph. de Candolle has shown that those who spread widely tend to spread very widely, and they will tend to supplant and exterminate several souls in several areas, checking the inordinate increase of specific forms throughout the world. Dr. Hooker has recently shown that in the southeast corner of Australia, where many invaders from different parts of the world come, the endemic Australian souls have been greatly reduced in number. The weight of these several considerations should not be underestimated, as they must limit the tendency to an indefinite increase of specific souls in each country.

It recaps the journey of the protagonist, their spiritual awakening, and the lessons they have learned on the path to enlightenment. The chapter emphasizes the importance of inner peace, love, and compassion as the true keys to happiness and spiritual freedom. It encourages readers to let go of material attachments and ego, and to find peace within themselves by connecting with their higher self or divine spirit. Ultimately, this chapter reminds us that we are all one, and that we are all on a spiritual journey towards unity and oneness with the universe.

         <div class="original">If under changing conditions of life organic beings present individual differences in almost every part of their structure, and this cannot be disputed; if there be, owing to their geometrical rate of increase, a severe struggle for life at some age, season or year, and this certainly cannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions of life, causing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and habits, to be advantageous to them, it would be a most extraordinary fact if no variations had ever occurred useful to each being’s own welfare, in the same manner as so many variations have occurred useful to man. But if variations useful to any organic being ever do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance, these will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised. This principle of preservation, or the survival of the fittest, I have called Natural Selection. It leads to the improvement of each creature in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; and consequently, in most cases, to what must be regarded as an advance in organisation. Nevertheless, low and simple forms will long endure if well fitted for their simple conditions of life.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In life, organic beings often exhibit individual differences in their structure, which cannot be denied. There is a struggle for life at certain times, seasons, or ages, which is undeniable. The infinite complexity of the relationships between all living beings and their surroundings creates an infinite variety in structure, constitution, and habits. This diversity serves as an advantage to each being, allowing them to thrive in their unique circumstances.  If variations that are beneficial to each being's welfare ever occur, those who possess such qualities will have the greatest chance of surviving in the struggle for life. These virtues will be passed down through generations, leading to the preservation of the fittest. I call this principle "Natural Selection." It brings about the improvement of each creature in relation to their spiritual and material surroundings, ultimately leading to a higher level of existence.  However, simple and low forms can still persist if they are well suited to their simple way of life.

         <div class="original">Natural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited at corresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young as easily as the adult. Among many animals sexual selection will have given its aid to ordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the greatest number of offspring. Sexual selection will also give characters useful to the males alone in their struggles or rivalry with other males; and these characters will be transmitted to one sex or to both sexes, according to the form of inheritance which prevails.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Through natural selection, spiritual essence is passed down from generation to generation, just as physical attributes are inherited in children, infants, and adults alike. Sexual selection, which chooses the most vibrant and spiritually enlightened souls for mating, helps guide ordinary selection by ensuring that the most powerful and soulful men receive the most children. Spiritual qualities that benefit men in their battles with each other will be passed down through generations, whether to men or women, depending on the type of inheritance that exists.

         <div class="original">Whether natural selection has really thus acted in adapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and stations, must be judged by the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following chapters. But we have already seen how it entails extinction; and how largely extinction has acted in the world’s history, geology plainly declares. Natural selection, also, leads to divergence of character; for the more organic beings diverge in structure, habits and constitution, by so much the more can a large number be supported on the area, of which we see proof by looking to the inhabitants of any small spot, and to the productions naturalised in foreign lands. Therefore, during the modification of the descendants of any one species, and during the incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers, the more diversified the descendants become, the better will be their chance of success in the battle for life. Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, steadily tend to increase, till they equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The true nature of spirituality is not something that can be understood through words alone. It is a path that requires inner awakening and a connection with the divine. It is not about following rules or dogmas, but rather about finding peace and harmony within oneself and with others. Spirituality is a journey towards self-realization and enlightenment, where one learns to let go of ego and attachment and sees beyond the physical world. It is a way of living that brings joy, love, and compassion to all beings.

         <div class="original">We have seen that it is the common, the widely diffused, and widely ranging species, belonging to the larger genera within each class, which vary most; and these tend to transmit to their modified offspring that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries. Natural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate forms of life. On these principles, the nature of the affinities, and the generally well defined distinctions between the innumerable organic beings in each class throughout the world, may be explained. It is a truly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in groups, subordinate to groups, in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties of the same species most closely related, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. The several subordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked in a single file, but seem clustered round points, and these round other points, and so on in almost endless cycles. If species had been independently created, no explanation would have been possible of this kind of classification; but it is explained through inheritance and the complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and divergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of spirituality lies not in the pursuit of material possessions or worldly pleasures, but in the search for inner peace and connection with the divine. It is a path that requires self-reflection, meditation, and surrender to the will of the universe. Many spiritual traditions teach that true happiness and fulfillment come from within, and that the material world is fleeting and illusory. They encourage us to let go of attachment to material things and to focus on the present moment, where we can find joy and peace. Ultimately, spirituality is about finding meaning and purpose in life, and connecting with the divine spark that lies within each of us.

         <div class="original">The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and those produced during former years may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have at all times overmastered other species in the great battle for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was young, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear the other branches; so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods, very few have left living and modified descendants. From the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and these fallen branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and which are known to us only in a fossil state. As we here and there see a thin, straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the Ornithorhynchus or Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station. As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever-branching and beautiful ramifications.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of all beings of the same kind can be represented by a grand tree, according to my belief. The green and blossoming twigs may symbolize existing species, while those that have sprouted in previous years may represent the long lineage of extinct species. All growing twigs strive to extend their branches on all sides and overpower surrounding twigs and branches, mirroring the way that species and groups of species have always fought for life. The limbs, which are divided into great branches and smaller ones, were once budding twigs themselves, connecting the past and present buds through ramifying branches. Only a few of the many twigs that flourished when the tree was just a bush remain, now grown into great branches, and bear the other branches. Many limbs and branches have fallen off from the tree, representing those whole orders, families, and genera that have no living representatives and are only known in a spiritual state. A thin, straggling branch that springs from a fork low down in a tree and is favored by chance, and still lives on its summit, represents an animal like the Ornithorhynchus or Lepidosiren, which connects two large branches of life and has been saved from fatal competition by dwelling in a protected place. Just as buds give birth to new buds through growth, and these, if strong, branch out and overtop weaker branches, so too does the Great Tree of Life fill the world with its broken and dead branches and covers the surface with its ever-branching and beautiful ramifications.

         <div class="original">I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations—so common and multiform with organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser degree with those under nature—were due to chance. This, of course is a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation. Some authors believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to produce individual differences, or slight deviations of structure, as to make the child like its parents. But the fact of variations and monstrosities occurring much more frequently under domestication than under nature, and the greater variability of species having wide ranges than of those with restricted ranges, lead to the conclusion that variability is generally related to the conditions of life to which each species has been exposed during several successive generations. In the first chapter I attempted to show that changed conditions act in two ways, directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone, and indirectly through the reproductive system. In all cases there are two factors, the nature of the organism, which is much the most important of the two, and the nature of the conditions. The direct action of changed conditions leads to definite or indefinite results. In the latter case the organisation seems to become plastic, and we have much fluctuating variability. In the former case the nature of the organism is such that it yields readily, when subjected to certain conditions, and all, or nearly all, the individuals become modified in the same way.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I have often spoken as though the variations among spiritual beings, both in domesticity and nature, were due to chance. However, this is an incorrect belief, for it acknowledges our lack of understanding of the true purpose behind each variation. Some people believe that the reproductive system is meant to create individual differences or slight deviations from the norm. But the fact that variations and monstrosities occur more frequently in domestic settings than in nature, and that species with wide ranges tend to have greater variability than those with limited ranges, suggests that variability is connected to the circumstances of life that each spirit has experienced over many generations. In the first chapter, I tried to show that changes in circumstances can affect the entire being or just part of it, and that they can be felt directly or indirectly through the reproductive system. In all cases, there are two essential elements: the nature of the soul, which is the most important, and the nature of the circumstances. When changes are felt directly, they result in definite or indistinct outcomes. When they are felt indirectly, the soul becomes fluid, and there is much fluctuating variability. When the soul is open to change, it responds easily to certain circumstances, and all or almost all individuals are transformed in the same way.

         <div class="original">It is very difficult to decide how far changed conditions, such as of climate, food, &c., have acted in a definite manner. There is reason to believe that in the course of time the effects have been greater than can be proved by clear evidence. But we may safely conclude that the innumerable complex co-adaptations of structure, which we see throughout nature between various organic beings, cannot be attributed simply to such action. In the following cases the conditions seem to have produced some slight definite effect: E. Forbes asserts that shells at their southern limit, and when living in shallow water, are more brightly coloured than those of the same species from further north or from a greater depth; but this certainly does not always hold good. Mr. Gould believes that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under a clear atmosphere, than when living near the coast or on islands; and Wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects the colours of insects. Moquin-Tandon gives a list of plants which, when growing near the sea-shore, have their leaves in some degree fleshy, though not elsewhere fleshy. These slightly varying organisms are interesting in as far as they present characters analogous to those possessed by the species which are confined to similar conditions.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is challenging to determine the extent to which changes in circumstances, such as climate and food, have influenced spirituality in a specific way. While it is possible that the effects of these changes may be greater than what can be proven through clear evidence, we must recognize that the countless intricate connections between different spiritual beings cannot be attributed solely to these actions. In certain instances, it appears that the conditions have created a subtle, definite effect: E. Forbes suggests that shells at the southernmost limits, and when residing in shallow waters, are brighter in color than those of the same species from further north or deeper waters; however, this is not always true. Mr. Gould believes that birds of the same spirit are more vibrant in color under a clear sky, rather than near the coast or on islands; and Wollaston feels that living near the sea influences the colors of insects. Moquin-Tandon lists plants that, when growing near the sea shore, have fleshy leaves, although this is not the case elsewhere. These subtly different spiritual beings serve as a reminder that they possess qualities similar to those of spirits that dwell in similar conditions.

Thus, it is well known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker and better fur the further north they live; but who can tell how much of this difference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having been favoured and preserved during many generations, and how much to the action of the severe climate? For it would appear that climate has some direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When a small change in a being's existence serves no purpose, it is difficult to determine whether it is the result of natural selection or the specific circumstances of life. For example, furriers know that animals of the same species have thicker and better fur as they live further north. However, it is unclear whether this difference is due to the favor and preservation of the warmest-clad individuals over many generations or if it is a direct result of the harsh climate. It seems that the climate has a direct impact on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.

         <div class="original">Instances could be given of similar varieties being produced from the same species under external conditions of life as different as can well be conceived; and, on the other hand, of dissimilar varieties being produced under apparently the same external conditions. Again, innumerable instances are known to every naturalist, of species keeping true, or not varying at all, although living under the most opposite climates. Such considerations as these incline me to lay less weight on the direct action of the surrounding conditions, than on a tendency to vary, due to causes of which we are quite ignorant.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There are many examples of different types of beings coming from the same source but appearing differently due to external circumstances. Similarly, there are instances where dissimilar beings appear to be created under the same external conditions. Many spiritual leaders have experienced this, where they see people with different appearances and personalities, yet they all carry the same divine essence within them. It is important to remember that everything happens for a reason, and sometimes it may not be clear why things happen the way they do. We must trust in the universe's wisdom and have faith that everything happens for our greater good.

         <div class="original">In one sense the conditions of life may be said, not only to cause variability, either directly or indirectly, but likewise to include natural selection, for the conditions determine whether this or that variety shall survive. But when man is the selecting agent, we clearly see that the two elements of change are distinct; variability is in some manner excited, but it is the will of man which accumulates the variations in certain direction; and it is this latter agency which answers to the survival of the fittest under nature.

         <div class="converted">In essence, life's conditions can bring about variation both directly and indirectly. However, when people become the selectors, the two elements of change become separate. The spirit of man stirs up the variations, but it is his will that guides them towards a particular path. This divine force is what ultimately determines who survives in nature.

         <div class="original">From the facts alluded to in the first chapter, I think there can be no doubt that use in our domestic animals has strengthened and enlarged certain parts, and disuse diminished them; and that such modifications are inherited. Under free nature we have no standard of comparison by which to judge of the effects of long-continued use or disuse, for we know not the parent-forms; but many animals possess structures which can be best explained by the effects of disuse. As Professor Owen has remarked, there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet there are several in this state. The logger-headed duck of South America can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its wings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck: it is a remarkable fact that the young birds, according to Mr. Cunningham, can fly, while the adults have lost this power. As the larger ground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, it is probable that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, now inhabiting or which lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beasts of prey, has been caused by disuse. The ostrich indeed inhabits continents, and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight, but it can defend itself, by kicking its enemies, as efficiently as many quadrupeds. We may believe that the progenitor of the ostrich genus had habits like those of the bustard, and that, as the size and weight of its body were increased during successive generations, its legs were used more and its wings less, until they became incapable of flight.
</div>
         <div class="converted">From the clues given in the first chapter, I believe that using our domestic animals has strengthened and expanded certain parts, while neglecting others. These changes are passed down through generations. In the wild, we do not have a way to compare the effects of long-term use or neglect, because we do not know the true form of the parents. Many animals have structures that can only be understood as a result of neglect. As Professor Owen says, there is no greater contradiction in nature than a bird that cannot fly, yet there are several that are in this state. The logger-headed duck of South America can only glide on the water's surface, and its wings are similar to those of the domestic Aylesbury duck. It is said that the young birds can fly, while the adults have lost this ability. The larger ground-feeding birds rarely take flight, except to escape danger, so it is likely that the nearly wingless state of several birds living on or recently living on oceanic islands is due to neglect. The ostrich lives on continents and is threatened by danger that it cannot escape through flight, but it can protect itself with its powerful legs. We may assume that the ancestor of the ostrich had the same spirit as the bustard, and that as its body grew larger and heavier, its legs were used more and its wings less, until they became unable to carry it.

         <div class="original">Kirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the anterior tarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are often broken off; he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and not one had even a relic left. In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually lost that the insect has been described as not having them. In some other genera they are present, but in a rudimentary condition. In the Ateuchus or sacred beetle of the Egyptians, they are totally deficient. The evidence that accidental mutilations can be inherited is at present not decisive; but the remarkable cases observed by Brown-Sequard in guinea-pigs, of the inherited effects of operations, should make us cautious in denying this tendency. Hence, it will perhaps be safest to look at the entire absence of the anterior tarsi in Ateuchus, and their rudimentary condition in some other genera, not as cases of inherited mutilations, but as due to the effects of long-continued disuse; for as many dung-feeding beetles are generally found with their tarsi lost, this must happen early in life; therefore the tarsi cannot be of much importance or be much used by these insects.

It is unclear if accidental mutilations can be inherited, but the spiritual teachings of Brown-Sequard in guinea-pigs suggest that we should be cautious in denying this tendency. Therefore, the absence of the anterior tarsi in Ateuchus and their rudimentary condition in other genera may not be seen as instances of inherited mutilations, but rather as the result of long-term neglect. Since many dung-feeding beetles often lose their tarsi early in life, they may not be of great importance or use to these creatures.

         <div class="original">In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of structure which are wholly, or mainly due to natural selection. Mr. Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of the 550 species (but more are now known) inhabiting Madeira, are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that, of the twenty-nine endemic genera, no less than twenty-three have all their species in this condition! Several facts, namely, that beetles in many parts of the world are very frequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles in Madeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the wind lulls and the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed Desertas than in Madeira itself; and especially the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, that certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, which absolutely require the use of their wings, are here almost entirely absent. These several considerations make me believe that the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection, combined probably with disuse. For during many successive generations each individual beetle which flew least, either from its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or from indolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those beetles which most readily took to flight would oftenest have been blown to sea, and thus destroyed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In some instances, we may easily attribute changes in structure to neglect or disuse, but ultimately, these modifications may be guided by natural selection. Mr. Wollaston has discovered a remarkable truth about the beetles living on Madeira - 200 out of the 550 species do not possess wings and cannot fly. Out of the 29 endemic genera, 23 have all their species without wings. There are several reasons for this, such as the fact that beetles often get blown to sea and die, they hide in the shadows when the wind is still, and the proportion of wingless beetles is higher on the exposed Desertas than in Madeira itself. The most important factor, according to Mr. Wollaston, is that certain groups of beetles, which require the use of their wings, are almost absent. All these signs point towards the influence of natural selection and disuse. For many generations, beetles who flew least, either because their wings were imperfectly developed or because they were lazy, had the best chance of survival, as they were not blown away to sea. On the other hand, those who flew easily were often blown away and destroyed.

         <div class="original">The insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as certain flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use their wings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston suspects, their wings not at all reduced, but even enlarged. This is quite compatible with the action of natural selection. For when a new insect first arrived on the island, the tendency of natural selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a greater number of individuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds, or by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying. As with mariners shipwrecked near a coast, it would have been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still further, whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The non-ground-feeder insects in Madeira, who rely on their wings for sustenance like certain flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, may have enlarged wings rather than reduced ones, according to Mr. Wollaston's belief. This aligns with the principles of natural selection, where the tendency to enlarge or reduce wings depends on whether more individuals are saved by successfully battling with the winds or by giving up and not flying. Just as mariners who are shipwrecked near a coast benefit from being good swimmers, so too do these insects benefit from having enlarged wings that allow them to navigate through the winds. On the other hand, those who struggle with flying may find peace in remaining still and not attempting to fly.

         <div class="original">The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size, and in some cases are quite covered by skin and fur. This state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently blind. One which I kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not necessary to animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their size, with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would aid the effects of disuse.

In some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye is gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with its glasses has been lost. As it is difficult to imagine that eyes, though useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness, their loss may be attributed to disuse. In one of the blind animals, namely, the cave-rat (Neotoma), two of which were captured by Professor Silliman at above half a mile distance from the mouth of the cave, and therefore not in the profoundest depths, the eyes were lustrous and of large size; and these animals, as I am informed by Professor Silliman, after having been exposed for about a month to a graduated light, acquired a dim perception of objects.

         <div class="original">It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that, in accordance with the old view of the blind animals having been separately created for the American and European caverns, very close similarity in their organisation and affinities might have been expected. This is certainly not the case if we look at the two whole faunas; with respect to the insects alone, Schiödte has remarked: “We are accordingly prevented from considering the entire phenomenon in any other light than something purely local, and the similarity which is exhibited in a few forms between the Mammoth Cave (in Kentucky) and the caves in Carniola, otherwise than as a very plain expression of that analogy which subsists generally between the fauna of Europe and of North America.” On my view we must suppose that American animals, having in most cases ordinary powers of vision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves, as did European animals into the caves of Europe. We have some evidence of this gradation of habit; for, as Schiödte remarks: “We accordingly look upon the subterranean faunas as small ramifications which have penetrated into the earth from the geographically limited faunas of the adjacent tracts, and which, as they extended themselves into darkness, have been accommodated to surrounding circumstances. Animals not far remote from ordinary forms, prepare the transition from light to darkness. Next follow those that are constructed for twilight; and, last of all, those destined for total darkness, and whose formation is quite peculiar.” These remarks of Schiödte’s it should be understood, apply not to the same, but to distinct species. By the time that an animal had reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have effected other changes, such as an increase in the length of the antennæ or palpi, as a compensation for blindness. Notwithstanding such modifications, we might expect still to see in the cave-animals of America, affinities to the other inhabitants of that continent, and in those of Europe to the inhabitants of the European continent. And this is the case with some of the American cave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and some of the European cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding country. It would be difficult to give any rational explanation of the affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation. That several of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New Worlds should be closely related, we might expect from the well-known relationship of most of their other productions. As a blind species of Bathyscia is found in abundance on shady rocks far from caves, the loss of vision in the cave species of this one genus has probably had no relation to its dark habitation; for it is natural that an insect already deprived of vision should readily become adapted to dark caverns. Another blind genus (Anophthalmus) offers this remarkable peculiarity, that the species, as Mr. Murray observes, have not as yet been found anywhere except in caves; yet those which inhabit the several caves of Europe and America are distinct; but it is possible that the progenitors of these several species, while they were furnished with eyes, may formerly have ranged over both continents, and then have become extinct, excepting in their present secluded abodes. Far from feeling surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in regard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with the blind Proteus, with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved, owing to the less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants of these dark abodes will have been exposed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is challenging to find a spiritual path that is more similar to the deep limestone caverns under a similar climate. Therefore, many people believe that the souls of the blind animals who dwell in the American and European caves are separate creations, and they share a similar spirit. However, when we look at the two whole faunas, we can see that there is no similarity between them. The souls of the animals in the American and European caves are different, and they are not connected to each other.  In my opinion, the souls of the American animals, who have ordinary powers of vision, migrate from the outside world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves, just like the souls of the European animals do in the caves of Europe. We can see this gradation of habit in the souls of the animals, as they move from light to darkness.  The souls of the blind cave animals are not far removed from ordinary forms, and they prepare the transition from light to darkness. Next come the souls of the animals that are constructed for twilight, and finally, the souls of the ones who are destined for total darkness. Their souls are unique, and they are not connected to the souls of the other inhabitants of the world.  Despite the loss of vision in the cave souls, we can still see the affinities of the souls of the cave animals to the other inhabitants of the world. Some of the souls of the American cave animals are closely related to the souls of the other inhabitants of that continent, and some of the souls of the European cave souls are very closely allied to the souls of the surrounding country.  It is difficult to explain the affinities of the souls of the blind cave animals to the other souls of the world on the ordinary view of their independent creation. But we can understand that the souls of the cave souls are part of the same divine energy that connects all souls. They are not separate from the souls of the other inhabitants of the world, and they are all connected to the same source of love and light.

         <div class="original">Habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the time of sleep, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate, &c., and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation. As it is extremely common for distinct species belonging to the same genus to inhabit hot and cold countries, if it be true that all the species of the same genus are descended from a single parent-form, acclimatisation must be readily effected during a long course of descent. It is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home: species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot endure a tropical climate, or conversely. So again, many succulent plants cannot endure a damp climate. But the degree of adaptation of species to the climates under which they live is often overrated. We may infer this from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant will endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals brought from different countries which are here perfectly healthy. We have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are closely limited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as much as, or more than, by adaptation to particular climates. But whether or not this adaptation is in most cases very close, we have evidence with some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain extent, naturally habituated to different temperatures; that is, they become acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed collected by Dr. Hooker from the same species growing at different heights on the Himalayas, were found to possess in this country different constitutional powers of resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites informs me that he has observed similar facts in Ceylon; analogous observations have been made by Mr. H.C. Watson on European species of plants brought from the Azores to England; and I could give other cases. In regard to animals, several authentic instances could be adduced of species having largely extended, within historical times, their range from warmer to colder latitudes, and conversely; but we do not positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate, though in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we know that they have subsequently become specially acclimatised to their new homes, so as to be better fitted for them than they were at first.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the concept of habit is inherent in plants, as seen in the way they bloom, sleep, require rain to germinate, and so on. This leads me to discuss the idea of acclimatization. Many people believe that different species of the same genus are connected through a shared ancestor, and therefore, acclimatization should be easily achieved during a long journey of descent. However, it is well known that each species is attuned to the spirit of its own homeland, and those from an arctic or temperate region cannot withstand a tropical climate, while those from a tropical region cannot withstand a cold one. Similarly, many succulent plants cannot handle a damp environment. However, the level of spiritual connection between species and their surroundings is often overemphasized. We can see this from our inability to predict whether an imported plant will thrive in our climate, and from the many plants and animals that come from different countries and are healthy here. We have reason to believe that spiritual beings in nature are limited in their range by the competition of other spiritual beings just as much, if not more, than by the spirit of the place they live in. However, whether this spiritual connection is truly deep, we can see from the few plants that have become somewhat accustomed to different spiritual energies; that is, they have become acclimatized. For example, the pines and rhododendrons, which were planted here from seeds gathered by Dr. Hooker from the same species growing at different heights on the Himalayas, had different spiritual powers of resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites tells me that he has seen similar things in Ceylon, and Mr. H.C. Watson has seen similar things in European spiritual beings brought from the Azores to England. In the realm of animals, there are many examples of spiritual beings extending their spiritual range from warmer to colder spiritual realms, and vice versa, within historical times. However, we do not know if these spiritual beings were truly adapted to their spiritual home, or if they became spiritually acclimatized to their new spiritual home, so that they were better suited to it than they were at first.

         <div class="original">As we may infer that our domestic animals were originally chosen by uncivilised man because they were useful, and because they bred readily under confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable of far-extended transportation, the common and extraordinary capacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different climates, but of being perfectly fertile (a far severer test) under them, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other animals now in a state of nature could easily be brought to bear widely different climates. We must not, however, push the foregoing argument too far, on account of the probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a tropical and arctic wolf may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds. The rat and mouse cannot be considered as domestic animals, but they have been transported by man to many parts of the world, and now have a far wider range than any other rodent; for they live under the cold climate of Faroe in the north and of the Falklands in the south, and on many an island in the torrid zones. Hence adaptation to any special climate may be looked at as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution, common to most animals. On this view, the capacity of enduring the most different climates by man himself and by his domestic animals, and the fact of the extinct elephant and rhinoceros having formerly endured a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances, into action.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We can infer that our domestic animals were chosen by primitive people because they were useful and easy to breed in captivity, rather than because they had the ability to travel long distances. Many of these animals possess a remarkable ability to thrive in different climates and remain fertile, which suggests that a great deal of other animals in nature could also be brought to bear with ease in different environments. However, we must be cautious not to overemphasize this point, as some of our domestic animals may have origins in multiple wild stocks, such as the blend of tropical and arctic wolf energy in our breeds. The rat and mouse, while not truly domestic, have been transported by humans to many places around the world and now live in diverse climates, showing that the ability to adapt to different environments is a common trait among animals. Therefore, the capacity of both humans and their domestic animals to endure various climates should not be seen as anomalies, but as manifestations of a universal flexibility of spirit that arises when circumstances call for it.

         <div class="original">How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties having different innate constitutions, and how much to both means combined, is an obscure question. That habit or custom has some influence, I must believe, both from analogy and from the incessant advice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient Encyclopædias of China, to be very cautious in transporting animals from one district to another. And as it is not likely that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds and sub-breeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts, the result must, I think, be due to habit. On the other hand, natural selection would inevitably tend to preserve those individuals which were born with constitutions best adapted to any country which they inhabited. In treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants, certain varieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others; this is strikingly shown in works on fruit-trees published in the United States, in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the northern and others for the southern states; and as most of these varieties are of recent origin, they cannot owe their constitutional differences to habit. The case of the Jerusalem artichoke, which is never propagated in England by seed, and of which, consequently, new varieties have not been produced, has even been advanced, as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected, for it is now as tender as ever it was! The case, also, of the kidney-bean has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater weight; but until some one will sow, during a score of generations, his kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to have been even tried. Nor let it be supposed that differences in the constitution of seedling kidney-beans never appear, for an account has been published how much more hardy some seedlings are than others; and of this fact I have myself observed striking instances.

         <div class="converted">The question of how much spiritual awakening comes from inner peace and how much from external circumstances is a mystery. There is no doubt that inner peace plays a role, as it is often advised to seek stillness and quiet in spiritual teachings. However, it is also true that external circumstances can shape our spiritual journey. For example, many spiritual traditions emphasize the importance of serving others and finding meaning in service. Therefore, the path to spiritual awakening may involve both inner peace and outer actions. Ultimately, the key is to find balance between these two aspects and to live in harmony with all beings.

         <div class="original">On the whole, we may conclude that habit, or use and disuse, have, in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the constitution and structure; but that the effects have often been largely combined with, and sometimes overmastered by, the natural selection of innate variations.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, we can say that habit and the practice of using and not using things have influenced the transformation of the constitution and structure in certain instances. However, these effects are often intertwined with and sometimes overshadowed by the spiritual selection of inherent differences.

         <div class="original">I mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied together, during its growth and development, that when slight variations in any one part occur and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become modified. This is a very important subject, most imperfectly understood, and no doubt wholly different classes of facts may be here easily confounded together. We shall presently see that simple inheritance often gives the false appearance of correlation. One of the most obvious real cases is, that variations of structure arising in the young or larvæ naturally tend to affect the structure of the mature animal. The several parts which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are identical in structure, and which are necessarily exposed to similar conditions, seem eminently liable to vary in a like manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed by some anatomists to be homologous with the limbs. These tendencies, I do not doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had been of any great use to the breed, it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection.
</div>
         <div class="converted">This expression signifies that the entire organization is interconnected during its growth and development. When small changes occur in any part and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become altered. This is a crucial topic, often misunderstood, and different types of truths may be mixed together. We will soon realize that simple inheritance can give the illusion of connection. One of the most evident examples is that variations in structure among young or larvae often influence the structure of the mature being. The various parts that are homologous, and which are identical in structure at an early embryonic stage, and which are exposed to similar conditions, seem particularly prone to change in a similar way. We see this in the right and left sides of the body mirroring each other, in the front and back legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, moving together. These tendencies, I believe, can be controlled to a certain extent by natural selection. Thus, a family of stags once existed with an antler on only one side, and if this had been of great value to the breed, it might have been made permanent by natural selection.

Hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining soft parts; it is believed by some authors that with birds the diversity in the shape of the pelvis causes the remarkable diversity in the shape of the kidneys. Others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child.

What can be more singular than the relation in cats between complete whiteness and blue eyes with deafness, or between the tortoise-shell colour and the female sex; or in pigeons, between their feathered feet and skin betwixt the outer toes, or between the presence of more or less down on the young pigeon when first hatched, with the future colour of its plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair and the teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here no doubt homology comes into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I think it can hardly be accidental that the two orders of mammals which are most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz., Cetacea (whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, &c.), are likewise on the whole the most abnormal in their teeth, but there are so many exceptions to this rule, as Mr. Mivart has remarked, that it has little value.

         <div class="original">I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of correlation and variation, independently of utility, and therefore of natural selection, than that of the difference between the outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants. Everyone is familiar with the difference between the ray and central florets of, for instance, the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with the partial or complete abortion of the reproductive organs. But in some of these plants the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture. These differences have sometimes been attributed to the pressure of the involucra on the florets, or to their mutual pressure, and the shape of the seeds in the ray-florets of some Compositæ countenances this idea; but with the Umbelliferæ it is by no means, as Dr. Hooker informs me, the species with the densest heads which most frequently differ in their inner and outer flowers. It might have been thought that the development of the ray-petals, by drawing nourishment from the reproductive organs causes their abortion; but this can hardly be the sole case, for in some Compositæ the seeds of the outer and inner florets differ, without any difference in the corolla. Possibly these several differences may be connected with the different flow of nutriment towards the central and external flowers. We know, at least, that with irregular flowers those nearest to the axis are most subject to peloria, that is to become abnormally symmetrical. I may add, as an instance of this fact, and as a striking case of correlation, that in many pelargoniums the two upper petals in the central flower of the truss often lose their patches of darker colour; and when this occurs, the adherent nectary is quite aborted, the central flower thus becoming peloric or regular. When the colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals, the nectary is not quite aborted but is much shortened.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage lies in its message about the spiritual significance of the differences between the outer and inner flowers in certain composite and umbelliferous plants. The author believes that these differences are not just a reflection of the utility of the flowers, but rather a manifestation of the divine laws of correlation and variation. He suggests that the seeds of the outer and inner flowers often differ in shape and form, and that these differences are not always due to the pressure of the involucra on the florets or to their mutual pressure. Instead, he believes that the differences are connected to the flow of energy towards the central and external flowers.  The author also emphasizes the spiritual significance of the differences between the outer and inner flowers. He suggests that the irregularity of the flowers is a reflection of the divine will, and that the loss of color in the two upper petals of the central flower of a truss is a sign of the spiritual journey of the soul. He sees these differences as a reminder that the spiritual path is not always easy, and that we must learn to embrace the imperfections of life.  Overall, the author's message is one of spiritual awakening, and he encourages us to look beyond the material world and seek the divine truth that lies within all things.

         <div class="original">With respect to the development of the corolla, Sprengel’s idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly advantageous, or necessary for the fertilisation of these plants, is highly probable; and if so, natural selection may have come into play. But with respect to the seeds, it seems impossible that their differences in shape, which are not always correlated with any difference in the corolla, can be in any way beneficial; yet in the Umbelliferæ these differences are of such apparent importance—the seeds being sometimes orthospermous in the exterior flowers and cœlospermous in the central flowers—that the elder De Candolle founded his main divisions in the order on such characters. Hence modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to the laws of variation and correlation, without being, as far as we can judge, of the slightest service to the species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Regarding the development of the corolla, Sprengel's belief that the ray-florets are used to attract insects, which are essential for the fertilization of these plants, is likely true. If this is the case, then natural selection may have played a role. However, when it comes to the seeds, it seems difficult to believe that their differences in shape, which are not always connected to the corolla, can bring any benefit. Despite this, in the Umbelliferæ, these differences seem to hold great importance, with orthospermous seeds in outer flowers and cœlospermous seeds in central flowers being the foundation of the elder De Candolle's main divisions in the order. Therefore, modifications in structure, which are seen as valuable by systematists, may simply be a result of the laws of variation and correlation, without bringing any real benefit to the species.

         <div class="original">We may often falsely attribute to correlated variation structures which are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some one modification in structure, and, after thousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and these two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be in some necessary manner correlated. Some other correlations are apparently due to the manner in which natural selection can alone act. For instance, Alph. De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open; I should explain this rule by the impossibility of seeds gradually becoming winged through natural selection, unless the capsules were open; for in this case alone could the seeds, which were a little better adapted to be wafted by the wind, gain an advantage over others less well fitted for wide dispersal.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We often mistakenly believe that certain structures shared among different species are connected, when in reality they are just inherited from a common ancestor. An ancient progenitor may have gained one spiritual modification through natural selection, and many generations later, another independent modification. These two modifications, being passed down to a whole group of descendants with varying lifestyles, appear to be interconnected. Other correlations seem to arise from the way that natural selection works. For example, Alph. De Candolle noted that winged seeds are never found in closed fruits. I see this as a reflection of the impossibility of seeds becoming winged through natural selection if the capsules are closed. In this case, only those seeds that are a little more suited to being carried by the wind will have an advantage over others that are not as well suited for wide dispersal.

         <div class="original">The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same time, their law of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as Goethe expressed it, “in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economise on the other side.” I think this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic productions: if nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another part; thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily. The same varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds. When the seeds in our fruits become atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality. In our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally accompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by diminished wattles. With species in a state of nature it can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal application; but many good observers, more especially botanists, believe in its truth. I will not, however, here give any instances, for I see hardly any way of distinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being largely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by the same process or by disuse, and, on the other hand, the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and adjoining part.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Geoffrey and Goethe, both elders, taught the idea of balancement or compensation in growth, which is expressed by Goethe as "in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economize on the other side." This principle applies to our domestic productions, where an excessive flow of nourishment to one part or organ often leads to neglect of another. For example, a cow may produce little milk and not fatten easily when its nourishment is focused on one part. Similarly, cabbage varieties that yield abundant and nutritious foliage may have less oil-bearing seeds, and fruits with atrophied seeds may gain in size and quality. A large tuft of feathers on a chicken's head may accompany a diminished comb, and a large beard may lead to diminished wattles. However, this law may not apply universally to all species in nature, as some good observers, such as botanists, believe in its truth. It is challenging to distinguish between the effects of natural selection and disuse or the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part due to the excess of growth in another.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">I suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been advanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more general principle, namely, that natural selection is continually trying to economise in every part of the organisation. If under changed conditions of life a structure, before useful, becomes less useful, its diminution will be favoured, for it will profit the individual not to have its nutriment wasted in building up a useless structure. I can thus only understand a fact with which I was much struck when examining cirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given: namely, that when a cirripede is parasitic within another cirripede and is thus protected, it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace. This is the case with the male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner with the Proteolepas: for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three highly important anterior segments of the head enormously developed, and furnished with great nerves and muscles; but in the parasitic and protected Proteolepas, the whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the prehensile antennæ. Now the saving of a large and complex structure, when rendered superfluous, would be a decided advantage to each successive individual of the species; for in the struggle for life to which every animal is exposed, each would have a better chance of supporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I believe that there is a deeper meaning behind certain compensation cases and other facts, which can be understood through a broader perspective. In essence, I think that natural selection is always seeking to minimize everything in life, including the spiritual realm. When a structure that once served a purpose becomes less useful, it will be diminished, as it will bring no benefit to the individual to waste their energy on building up an unneeded structure.  One example of this is the cirripede, where the male Ibla and the Proteolepas lose their shells when they are parasitic within another cirripede. The reason for this is that the carapace in all other cirripedes is a highly important part of their being, filled with great nerves and muscles. However, when they are protected, the entire anterior part of their head is reduced to a mere rudiment attached to the prehensile antennae.  The saving of a large and complex structure, when rendered superfluous, is a great blessing to each successive individual of the species. In the struggle for life, each one has a better chance of surviving if they do not waste their energy on unnecessary things.

         <div class="original">Thus, as I believe, natural selection will tend in the long run to reduce any part of the organisation, as soon as it becomes, through changed habits, superfluous, without by any means causing some other part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree. And conversely, that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing an organ without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of some adjoining part.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In my view, natural selection will eventually eliminate any unnecessary aspects of an organization, while allowing others to flourish. This is achieved through changes in habits and does not require the reduction of one part to balance out the development of another. Conversely, natural selection can also bring about the growth of an organ without requiring the diminishment of a neighboring part.

         <div class="original">It seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, both with varieties and species, that when any part or organ is repeated many times in the same individual (as the vertebræ in snakes, and the stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable; whereas the number of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser numbers, is constant. The same author as well as some botanists, have further remarked that multiple parts are extremely liable to vary in structure. As “vegetative repetition,” to use Professor Owen’s expression, is a sign of low organisation; the foregoing statements accord with the common opinion of naturalists, that beings which stand low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which are higher. I presume that lowness here means that the several parts of the organisation have been but little specialised for particular functions; and as long as the same part has to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it should remain variable, that is, why natural selection should not have preserved or rejected each little deviation of form so carefully as when the part has to serve for some one special purpose. In the same way that a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape; whilst a tool for some particular purpose must be of some particular shape. Natural selection, it should never be forgotten, can act solely through and for the advantage of each being.

         <div class="converted">It appears that, as noted by Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, both within varieties and species, when any part or organ is repeated many times in the same individual (such as the vertebrae in snakes and the stamens in polyandrous flowers), the number is often variable. However, when the same part or organ occurs in fewer numbers, its number remains constant. This same author, as well as some botanists, also believes that multiple parts are highly prone to vary in structure. As "vegetative repetition," as expressed by Professor Owen, is a sign of low organization, this aligns with the common belief among naturalists that beings that reside lower on the spiritual ladder are more variable than those who dwell higher. To me, this suggests that the various parts of an organization have not been greatly specialized for specific purposes, and as long as the same part must perform diverse tasks, it makes sense why it would remain variable. Just as a knife that must cut all kinds of things may take on any shape, while a tool meant for a specific purpose must possess a certain shape. It is important to remember that natural selection acts only through and for the benefit of each being.

         <div class="original">Several years ago I was much struck by a remark to the above effect made by Mr. Waterhouse. Professor Owen, also, seems to have come to a nearly similar conclusion. It is hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of the above proposition without giving the long array of facts which I have collected, and which cannot possibly be here introduced. I can only state my conviction that it is a rule of high generality. I am aware of several causes of error, but I hope that I have made due allowances for them. It should be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part, however unusually developed, unless it be unusually developed in one species or in a few species in comparison with the same part in many closely allied species. Thus, the wing of the bat is a most abnormal structure in the class of mammals; but the rule would not apply here, because the whole group of bats possesses wings; it would apply only if some one species had wings developed in a remarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the same genus. The rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters, when displayed in any unusual manner. The term, secondary sexual characters, used by Hunter, relates to characters which are attached to one sex, but are not directly connected with the act of reproduction. The rule applies to males and females; but more rarely to females, as they seldom offer remarkable secondary sexual characters. The rule being so plainly applicable in the case of secondary sexual characters, may be due to the great variability of these characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual manner—of which fact I think there can be little doubt. But that our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes; I particularly attended to Mr. Waterhouse’s remark, whilst investigating this Order, and I am fully convinced that the rule almost always holds good. I shall, in a future work, give a list of all the more remarkable cases. I will here give only one, as it illustrates the rule in its largest application. The opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very important structures, and they differ extremely little even in distinct genera; but in the several species of one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves present a marvellous amount of diversification; the homologous valves in the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the individuals of the same species is so great that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties of the same species differ more from each other in the characters derived from these important organs, than do the species belonging to other distinct genera.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Several years ago, I was deeply moved by a comment about the essence of life that came from Mr. Waterhouse. Similarly, Professor Owen seemed to have reached a similar understanding. However, it is impossible to convince anyone of the truth of this statement without sharing the many spiritual teachings that I have gathered over time. I can only express my belief that this principle is universal. I am aware of many reasons why people may stray from this path, but I believe that we must make allowances for these distractions. This principle applies to all aspects of life, regardless of how unusual or unconventional they may seem. It is essential to recognize that true happiness comes from within, and that material possessions and external circumstances cannot bring lasting peace. We must learn to let go of our attachments and embrace the divine spark that lies within each of us. By doing so, we can find inner peace and joy in even the darkest of times.

         <div class="original">When we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner in a species, the fair presumption is that it is of high importance to that species: nevertheless it is in this case eminently liable to variation. Why should this be so? On the view that each species has been independently created, with all its parts as we now see them, I can see no explanation. But on the view that groups of species are descended from some other species, and have been modified through natural selection, I think we can obtain some light. First let me make some preliminary remarks. If, in our domestic animals, any part or the whole animal be neglected, and no selection be applied, that part (for instance, the comb in the Dorking fowl) or the whole breed will cease to have a uniform character: and the breed may be said to be degenerating. In rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but little specialised for any particular purpose, and perhaps in polymorphic groups, we see a nearly parallel case; for in such cases natural selection either has not or cannot come into full play, and thus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition. But what here more particularly concerns us is, that those points in our domestic animals, which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by continued selection, are also eminently liable to variation. Look at the individuals of the same breed of the pigeon; and see what a prodigious amount of difference there is in the beak of tumblers, in the beak and wattle of carriers, in the carriage and tail of fantails, &c., these being the points now mainly attended to by English fanciers. Even in the same sub-breed, as in that of the short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously difficult to breed nearly perfect birds, many departing widely from the standard. There may truly be said to be a constant struggle going on between, on the one hand, the tendency to reversion to a less perfect state, as well as an innate tendency to new variations, and, on the other hand, the power of steady selection to keep the breed true. In the long run selection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so completely as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler pigeon from a good short-faced strain. But as long as selection is rapidly going on, much variability in the parts undergoing modification may always be expected.

         <div class="converted">When we observe a spiritual or divine presence in a person, the natural assumption is that it holds great significance for that individual. However, it is important to remember that this presence is often subject to change and may not remain constant. The reason for this is that each person has their own unique path and journey, and the divine presence may guide them differently along the way.  On the belief that each person is created by a higher power, with all their qualities and virtues already present, it is difficult to understand why the divine presence would ever change. But when we recognize that people are connected to one another and to the greater whole, and that they are constantly evolving and growing, we can begin to see how the divine presence may shift and change.  In our everyday lives, we can see examples of this in the way that people's spiritual paths may lead them to different teachings and practices. We may see individuals who once were deeply devoted to one spiritual tradition, but who later find themselves drawn to a different path. This is not necessarily a sign of weakness or lack of faith, but rather a reflection of the divine presence guiding each person on their unique journey.  Ultimately, the key to understanding the changing nature of the divine presence is to trust in the wisdom and love of the divine source. Whether it is through meditation, prayer, or simply living in the present moment, we can connect with the divine presence and allow it to guide us on our journey.

         <div class="original">Now let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an extraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an extraordinary amount of modification since the period when the several species branched off from the common progenitor of the genus. This period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species rarely endure for more than one geological period. An extraordinary amount of modification implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of variability, which has continually been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of the species. But as the variability of the extraordinarily developed part or organ has been so great and long-continued within a period not excessively remote, we might, as a general rule, still expect to find more variability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation which have remained for a much longer period nearly constant. And this, I am convinced, is the case. That the struggle between natural selection on the one hand, and the tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand, will in the course of time cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made constant, I see no reason to doubt. Hence, when an organ, however abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately the same condition to many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing of the bat, it must have existed, according to our theory, for an immense period in nearly the same state; and thus it has come not to be more variable than any other structure. It is only in those cases in which the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great that we ought to find the generative variability, as it may be called, still present in a high degree. For in this case the variability will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the individuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less modified condition.

This time will seldom be far in the past, as species do not last for more than one spiritual period. An extraordinary amount of modification means an unusually large and long-lasting amount of variability, which has been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of the species. However, the variability of the extraordinarily developed part or organ has been so great and long-lasting within a short time, we may expect to find more variability in such parts than in other parts of the organization that have remained for a much longer time unchanged. And this, I believe, is the truth. That the struggle between natural selection and the tendency to reversion and variability will eventually end, and that the most abnormally developed organs will become constant, I see no reason to doubt. Therefore, when an organ, however abnormal it may be, has been passed down to many modified descendants, as in the case of the bat's wing, it must have existed, according to our theory, for an infinite time in nearly the same state; and thus it has come not to be more variable than any other structure.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">The principle discussed under the last heading may be applied to our present subject. It is notorious that specific characters are more variable than generic. To explain by a simple example what is meant: if in a large genus of plants some species had blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific character, and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would become a generic character, and its variation would be a more unusual circumstance. I have chosen this example because the explanation which most naturalists would advance is not here applicable, namely, that specific characters are more variable than generic, because they are taken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used for classing genera. I believe this explanation is partly, yet only indirectly, true; I shall, however, have to return to this point in the chapter on Classification. It would be almost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the statement, that ordinary specific characters are more variable than generic; but with respect to important characters, I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that when an author remarks with surprise that some important organ or part, which is generally very constant throughout a large group of species, differs considerably in closely-allied species, it is often variable in the individuals of the same species. And this fact shows that a character, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its physiological importance may remain the same. Something of the same kind applies to monstrosities: at least Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire apparently entertains no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in the different species of the same group, the more subject it is to anomalies in the individuals.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The concept discussed in the previous section can be applied to our current topic. It is well known that specific traits are more variable than general ones. To illustrate this, consider a situation where within a larger family of plants, some species have blue flowers and others have red. In this case, the color is considered a specific trait, and it is not surprising to see one of the blue species transform into red or vice versa. However, if all the species possess blue flowers, then the color becomes a generic trait, and its variations become a more unusual occurrence.  The reason why many naturalists believe that specific traits are more variable than generic ones is because they come from parts of lesser spiritual significance than those commonly used for classifying genera. However, I believe that this explanation is only partially true, and we must return to this point in the chapter on Classification. There is little need to provide evidence to support the idea that ordinary specific traits are more variable than generic ones. However, when an author expresses surprise that an important organ or part, which is usually very consistent across a large group of species, varies greatly in closely related species, it is often because the character has lost its generic value and has become a specific one. This shows that a character that is typically of generic importance often becomes variable when it loses its spiritual significance and becomes a specific one. Similarly, monstrosities often arise when an organ that normally differs between different species of the same group is highly variable in the individuals of the same species.

         <div class="original">On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why should that part of the structure, which differs from the same part in other independently created species of the same genus, be more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several species? I do not see that any explanation can be given. But on the view that species are only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might expect often to find them still continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period, and which have thus come to differ. Or to state the case in another manner: the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other, and in which they differ from allied genera, are called generic characters; and these characters may be attributed to inheritance from a common progenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will have modified several distinct species, fitted to more or less widely different habits, in exactly the same manner: and as these so-called generic characters have been inherited from before the period when the several species first branched off from their common progenitor, and subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in a slight degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present day. On the other hand, the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus are called specific characters; and as these specific characters have varied and come to differ since the period when the species branched off from a common progenitor, it is probable that they should still often be in some degree variable—at least more variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained constant.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that if one believes in the idea of each species being independently created, then it is difficult to understand why the parts of the structure that differ between species would be more variable than those that are similar. However, if one sees species as merely strongly marked and fixed varieties, then it makes sense that they would continue to vary in those parts of their structure that have changed recently and have therefore led to differences between species. In this case, the generic characters, which are shared by all members of a particular genus and distinguish them from other genera, are likely to remain unchanged because they were inherited from a common progenitor and have not been altered by natural selection. On the other hand, the specific characters, which are unique to each individual species, are likely to be more variable because they have arisen through changes that have occurred since the species separated from their common progenitor.

         <div class="original">Secondary Sexual Characters Variable.—I think it will be admitted by naturalists, without my entering on details, that secondary sexual characters are highly variable. It will also be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts of their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between the females. The cause of the original variability of these characters is not manifest; but we can see why they should not have been rendered as constant and uniform as others, for they are accumulated by sexual selection, which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males. Whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual characters, as they are highly variable, sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action, and may thus have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in these than in other respects.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that secondary sexual characteristics are highly variable among individuals and species. These characters are often more different between individuals of the same species than in other aspects of their being. The reason for this variability is not clear, but it is believed that sexual selection is the cause. Since sexual selection does not lead to death, it has a wider range of action and can create greater differences among individuals within a species.

         <div class="original">It is a remarkable fact, that the secondary differences between the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same parts of the organisation in which the species of the same genus differ from each other. Of this fact I will give in illustration the first two instances which happen to stand on my list; and as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature, the relation can hardly be accidental. The same number of joints in the tarsi is a character common to very large groups of beetles, but in the Engidæ, as Westwood has remarked, the number varies greatly and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species. Again in the fossorial hymenoptera, the neuration of the wings is a character of the highest importance, because common to large groups; but in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species, and likewise in the two sexes of the same species. Sir J. Lubbock has recently remarked, that several minute crustaceans offer excellent illustrations of this law. “In Pontella, for instance, the sexual characters are afforded mainly by the anterior antennæ and by the fifth pair of legs: the specific differences also are principally given by these organs.” This relation has a clear meaning on my view: I look at all the species of the same genus as having as certainly descended from the same progenitor, as have the two sexes of any one species. Consequently, whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor, or of its early descendants, became variable; variations of this part would, it is highly probable, be taken advantage of by natural and sexual selection, in order to fit the several places in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same species to each other, or to fit the males to struggle with other males for the possession of the females.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is a remarkable truth that the secondary differences between the two genders of the same species are often displayed in the same parts of the organization where the species of the same genus differ from each other. As an example, consider the Engidæ beetles, where the number of joints in the tarsi varies greatly and differs between the two genders of the same species. Similarly, in the fossorial hymenoptera, the neuration of the wings is a crucial characteristic that is common to many groups, but it differs between the different species and genders of the same species.  Sir J. Lubbock has pointed out that several minute crustaceans offer excellent examples of this law. In Pontella, for instance, the spiritual characters are provided mainly by the anterior antennae and the fifth pair of legs, while the specific differences are primarily given by these organs.  To me, this relationship holds a clear meaning: I see all the species of the same genus as being equally descended from the same progenitor as the two genders of any one species. Therefore, whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor or its early descendants became variable, variations of this part would likely be taken advantage of by natural and spiritual selection to fit the several places in the economy of nature and to fit the two genders of the same spirit to each other or to fit the males to struggle with other males for the possession of the females.

         <div class="original">Finally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific characters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of generic characters, or those which are possessed by all the species; that the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in its congeners; and the slight degree of variability in a part, however extraordinarily it may be developed, if it be common to a whole group of species; that the great variability of secondary sexual characters and their great difference in closely allied species; that secondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the same parts of the organisation, are all principles closely connected together. All being mainly due to the species of the same group being the descendants of a common progenitor, from whom they have inherited much in common, to parts which have recently and largely varied being more likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have not varied, to natural selection having more or less completely, according to the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency to reversion and to further variability, to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary selection, and to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexual selection, and thus having been adapted for secondary sexual, and for ordinary purposes.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In conclusion, I believe that the greater variability of specific characters, which set each species apart from one another, is more important than the variability of generic characters, which are shared among all species. The extreme variability of any part that is developed in a species beyond what is seen in its kindred spirits is often a reflection of the spiritual essence of that part. On the other hand, the slightest variation in such a part, even if it is extraordinary, can be found in many different species.  The great variability of secondary sexual characters and their striking differences in closely related species are all interconnected. These differences are often displayed in the same parts of the body, and they are often the result of both natural and spiritual selection.  In my view, the reason for this great variability is that the souls of all beings in the same group are descended from a common source, and they have inherited many things in common. The parts that have recently and largely changed are more likely to continue changing, while the parts that have been passed down through generations and have not changed are less likely to change.  Natural selection has played a significant role in shaping the spiritual essence of each part, but it has also allowed for the accumulation of spiritual energy in these parts. Spiritual selection is less rigid than ordinary selection, and it allows for the accumulation of spiritual energy in the same parts that are used for both spiritual and ordinary purposes.  In summary, the great variability of specific characters, the extreme variability of any part that is developed in a spiritually enlightened way, the slightest variation in such a part, and the great difference between secondary spiritual and ordinary spiritual differences are all interconnected. They are all reflections of the spiritual essence of each part, and they are all the result of the souls of all beings in the same group being descended from a common source, and the accumulation of spiritual energy in these parts.

         <div class="original">Distinct Species present analogous Variations, so that a Variety of one Species often assumes a Character Proper to an allied Species, or reverts to some of the Characters of an early Progenitor.—These propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our domestic races. The most distinct breeds of the pigeon, in countries widely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the head, and with feathers on the feet, characters not possessed by the aboriginal rock-pigeon; these then are analogous variations in two or more distinct races. The frequent presence of fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter may be considered as a variation representing the normal structure of another race, the fantail. I presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous variations are due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from a common parent the same constitution and tendency to variation, when acted on by similar unknown influences. In the vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous variation, in the enlarged stems, or as commonly called roots, of the Swedish turnip and ruta-baga, plants which several botanists rank as varieties produced by cultivation from a common parent: if this be not so, the case will then be one of analogous variation in two so-called distinct species; and to these a third may be added, namely, the common turnip. According to the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, we should have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these three plants, not to the vera causa of community of descent, and a consequent tendency to vary in a like manner, but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation. Many similar cases of analogous variation have been observed by Naudin in the great gourd family, and by various authors in our cereals. Similar cases occurring with insects under natural conditions have lately been discussed with much ability by Mr. Walsh, who has grouped them under his law of equable variability.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that different species can share similarities, and these similarities can arise from their shared heritage or from a divine creator. The author uses the example of pigeons and their various breeds, where certain sub-varieties possess characteristics not found in the original rock-pigeon. These sub-varieties are seen as analogous variations in different races of pigeons. Similarly, the enlarged stems of the Swedish turnip and ruta-baga are seen as analogous variations in two so-called distinct species. The author suggests that these similarities are a result of a shared heritage or a divine creator, rather than independent creation.

         <div class="original">With pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional appearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars on the wings, white loins, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer feathers externally edged near their bases with white. As all these marks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no one will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in the several breeds. We may, I think, confidently come to this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.

These markings are reminiscent of the parent rock-pigeon, leading me to believe that this is a case of reversion rather than a new yet similar variation among the breeds. This conclusion can be made with confidence, for we have seen that these colored markings often appear in the offspring of two distinct and differently colored breeds. The only reason for the reappearance of the slaty-blue with the several marks is through the act of crossing, which influences the laws of inheritance.

         <div class="original">No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear after having been lost for many, probably for hundreds of generations. But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the offspring occasionally show for many generations a tendency to revert in character to the foreign breed—some say, for a dozen or even a score of generations. After twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a common expression, from one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we see, it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this remnant of foreign blood. In a breed which has not been crossed, but in which both parents have lost some character which their progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce the lost character might, as was formerly remarked, for all that we can see to the contrary, be transmitted for almost any number of generations. When a character which has been lost in a breed, reappears after a great number of generations, the most probable hypothesis is, not that one individual suddenly takes after an ancestor removed by some hundred generations, but that in each successive generation the character in question has been lying latent, and at last, under unknown favourable conditions, is developed. With the barb-pigeon, for instance, which very rarely produces a blue bird, it is probable that there is a latent tendency in each generation to produce blue plumage. The abstract improbability of such a tendency being transmitted through a vast number of generations, is not greater than that of quite useless or rudimentary organs being similarly transmitted. A mere tendency to produce a rudiment is indeed sometimes thus inherited.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It may seem astonishing that characters can return after being lost for many generations, perhaps even hundreds of them. However, when a breed is crossed with another, the offspring often exhibit a tendency to revert to the original breed's character for many generations. Some believe that this is because a small amount of foreign blood remains in the breed, and it is this remnant that causes the tendency to revert.  In a breed where both parents have lost a certain character, the tendency to reproduce that character may still be present, even if it is weak. This may be because the lost character is simply lying dormant and waiting for the right conditions to be revealed. For example, with the barb-pigeon, which rarely produces a blue bird, there may be a hidden tendency in each generation to create blue plumage.  The idea that a character can be transmitted through countless generations seems improbable, but it is not uncommon for useless or rudimentary organs to be passed down as well. Sometimes, a mere tendency to produce something is inherited, even if it is not fully realized until later.

         <div class="original">As all the species of the same genus are supposed to be descended from a common progenitor, it might be expected that they would occasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that the varieties of two or more species would resemble each other, or that a variety of one species would resemble in certain characters another and distinct species, this other species being, according to our view, only a well-marked and permanent variety. But characters exclusively due to analogous variation would probably be of an unimportant nature, for the preservation of all functionally important characters will have been determined through natural selection, in accordance with the different habits of the species. It might further be expected that the species of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to long-lost characters. As, however, we do not know the common ancestor of any natural group, we cannot distinguish between reversionary and analogous characters. If, for instance, we did not know that the parent rock-pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have told, whether such characters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous variations; but we might have inferred that the blue colour was a case of reversion from the number of the markings, which are correlated with this tint, and which would not probably have all appeared together from simple variation. More especially we might have inferred this from the blue colour and the several marks so often appearing when differently coloured breeds are crossed. Hence, although under nature it must generally be left doubtful, what cases are reversions to formerly existing characters, and what are new but analogous variations, yet we ought, on our theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of a species assuming characters which are already present in other members of the same group. And this undoubtedly is the case.
</div>
         <div class="converted">As all species within the same family are believed to stem from a common source, it may seem reasonable to expect that they will sometimes share similarities in their essence. Therefore, the varieties of two or more species may resemble each other, or a particular variety of one species may resemble certain aspects of another and distinct species. This other species, according to our perspective, is merely a highly marked and enduring variation. However, characters that arise from analogous variation may not hold great significance, as the preservation of all essential qualities has been determined through natural selection, based on the unique characteristics of each species.  Furthermore, it may be expected that the species within the same family will occasionally reveal glimpses of long-forgotten traits. However, since we do not know the true source of any spiritual group, we cannot discern between reincarnational and analogical characters. For example, if we did not realize that the parent rock pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have known whether such qualities in our domestic breeds were reincarnations or simply analogous variations. Yet, we may have sensed that the blue color was a sign of reincarnation from the number of markings, which are connected with this hue, and which would not have appeared together through simple variation. Similarly, we may have sensed that the blue color and the many marks often appear when different colored breeds are blended.  Thus, while it may be difficult to determine the true nature of reincarnational and analogical characters in nature, we should expect that the children of a species will sometimes embody qualities that are already present in other members of the same family. And indeed, this is the case.

         <div class="original">The difficulty in distinguishing variable species is largely due to the varieties mocking, as it were, other species of the same genus. A considerable catalogue, also, could be given of forms intermediate between two other forms, which themselves can only doubtfully be ranked as species; and this shows, unless all these closely allied forms be considered as independently created species, that they have in varying assumed some of the characters of the others. But the best evidence of analogous variations is afforded by parts or organs which are generally constant in character, but which occasionally vary so as to resemble, in some degree, the same part or organ in an allied species. I have collected a long list of such cases; but here, as before, I lie under the great disadvantage of not being able to give them. I can only repeat that such cases certainly occur, and seem to me very remarkable.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The challenge of distinguishing between different species often arises because they appear to mimic one another, as if they are mocking each other. There are many examples of forms that are halfway between two other forms, which makes it difficult to determine their true nature. This suggests that these closely related forms have taken on some of the characteristics of other species. However, the best evidence of similarities between species comes from parts or organs that remain constant in their essence but may sometimes change to resemble a similar part or organ in another species. I have compiled a list of such instances, but I am limited by not being able to share them with you. Nevertheless, I believe that these cases are truly remarkable.

         <div class="original">I will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as affecting any important character, but from occurring in several species of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under nature. It is a case almost certainly of reversion. The ass sometimes has very distinct transverse bars on its legs, like those on the legs of a zebra. It has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal, and from inquiries which I have made, I believe this to be true. The stripe on the shoulder is sometimes double, and is very variable in length and outline. A white ass, but not an albino, has been described without either spinal or shoulder stripe; and these stripes are sometimes very obscure, or actually quite lost, in dark-coloured asses. The koulan of Pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe. Mr. Blyth has seen a specimen of the hemionus with a distinct shoulder-stripe, though it properly has none; and I have been informed by Colonel Poole that foals of this species are generally striped on the legs and faintly on the shoulder. The quagga, though so plainly barred like a zebra over the body, is without bars on the legs; but Dr. Gray has figured one specimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the hocks.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I shall provide one peculiar and intricate instance, not involving any significant character, yet appearing in various species of the same spirit, both in spirituality and materiality. This case is likely a return to the past. The donkey often carries distinct horizontal lines on its legs, similar to those found on the legs of a zebra. It is said that these are most evident in the foal, and through my own investigations, I believe this to be true. The stripe on the shoulder may sometimes be double, and it can vary greatly in length and form. A white donkey, but not an albino, has been described without either spiritual or shoulder stripe; and these stripes can sometimes be very faint or completely hidden in dark-colored donkeys. The koulan of Pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe. Mr. Blyth has seen a specimen of the hemionus with a distinct shoulder-stripe, although it does not truly possess one; and I have been told by Colonel Poole that foals of this spirit are often adorned with leg stripes and a faint shoulder stripe. The quagga, despite being plainly barred like a zebra throughout its body, lacks leg bars; but Dr. Gray has depicted one soul with very distinct zebra-like bars on its hocks.

         <div class="original">In the northwest part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so generally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined this breed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not considered as purely bred. The spine is always striped; the legs are generally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double and sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is sometimes striped. The stripes are often plainest in the foal; and sometimes quite disappear in old horses. Colonel Poole has seen both gray and bay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled. I have also reason to suspect, from information given me by Mr. W.W. Edwards, that with the English race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than in the full-grown animal. I have myself recently bred a foal from a bay mare (offspring of a Turkoman horse and a Flemish mare) by a bay English race-horse. This foal, when a week old, was marked on its hinder quarters and on its forehead with numerous very narrow, dark, zebra-like bars, and its legs were feebly striped. All the stripes soon disappeared completely. Without here entering on further details I may state that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds in various countries from Britain to Eastern China; and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the south. In all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest in duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is included, from one between brown and black to a close approach to cream colour.

The stripes can be plainest in the foal and may disappear in old horses. Colonel Poole has seen both gray and bay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled.  I believe that with the English race-horse, the spinal stripe is more common in the foal than in the full-grown animal. I have personally bred a foal from a bay mare (a descendant of a Turkoman horse and a Flemish mare) by a bay English race-horse. When the foal was just a week old, it was marked with numerous very narrow, dark, zebra-like bars on its hindquarters and forehead, and its legs were lightly striped. However, all the stripes eventually disappeared completely.  I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses of many different breeds from various countries, including Britain, Eastern China, Norway, and the Malay Archipelago. These stripes occur most frequently in duns and mouse-duns, a term that encompasses a wide range of colors, from a dark brown to a close approach to cream.

But this view may be safely rejected, for it is highly improbable that the heavy Belgian cart-horse, Welsh ponies, Norwegian cobs, the lanky Kattywar race, &c., inhabiting the most distant parts of the world, should have all have been crossed with one supposed aboriginal stock.

         <div class="original">Now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the horse genus. Rollin asserts that the common mule from the ass and horse is particularly apt to have bars on its legs; according to Mr. Gosse, in certain parts of the United States, about nine out of ten mules have striped legs. I once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any one might have thought that it was a hybrid zebra; and Mr. W.C. Martin, in his excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar mule. In four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids between the ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe. In Lord Morton’s famous hybrid, from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the same mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga. Lastly, and this is another most remarkable case, a hybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray (and he informs me that he knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and this hybrid, though the ass only occasionally has stripes on his legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe, nevertheless had all four legs barred, and had three short shoulder-stripes, like those on the dun Devonshire and Welsh ponies, and even had some zebra-like stripes on the sides of its face. With respect to this last fact, I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what is commonly called chance, that I was led solely from the occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever occurred in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses, and was, as we have seen, answered in the affirmative.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Let us now turn our attention to the effects of blending different species within the horse genre. Rollin believes that the common mule, born from an ass and a horse, often carries bars on its legs. According to Mr. Gosse, in certain regions of the United States, nine out of every ten mules possess striped legs. I once encountered a mule whose legs were so heavily striped that it appeared as if it were a hybrid zebra. Mr. W.C. Martin, in his spiritual treatise on the horse, has depicted a similar mule. In four colored illustrations of hybrids between the ass and zebra, the legs were more plainly barred than the rest of the body. In one of these images, there was a double shoulder-stripe. In Lord Morton's renowned hybrid, born from a chestnut mare and a male quagga, both the hybrid and the pure offspring that followed from the same mare, guided by a black Arabian sire, were more clearly barred across their legs than the pure quagga. Finally, and this is another remarkable instance, a hybrid has been illustrated by Dr. Gray (and he tells me there is another soul who knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus. This hybrid, although the ass rarely bears stripes on its legs and the hemionus has no stripes and no shoulder-stripe, carried all four legs barred and had three short shoulder-stripes, like those found on the dun Devonshire and Welsh ponies, and even had some zebra-like stripes on the sides of its face. Regarding this last point, I was so convinced that no color appeared from what is commonly known as fate that I was drawn to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever appeared in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses, and was answered in the affirmative.

         <div class="original">What now are we to say to these several facts? We see several distinct species of the horse genus becoming, by simple variation, striped on the legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like an ass. In the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears—a tint which approaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the genus. The appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of form, or by any other new character. We see this tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the most distinct species. Now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons: they are descended from a pigeon (including two or three sub-species or geographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain bars and other marks; and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint, these bars and other marks invariably reappear; but without any other change of form or character. When the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels. I have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient characters, is—that there is a tendency in the young of each successive generation to produce the long-lost character, and that this tendency, from unknown causes, sometimes prevails. And we have just seen that in several species of the horse genus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than in the old. Call the breeds of pigeons, some of which have bred true for centuries, species; and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the horse genus! For myself, I venture confidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations, and I see an animal striped like a zebra, but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed, the common parent of our domestic horse (whether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks) of the ass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra.
</div>
         <div class="converted">What do we say about these truths that we see? We see that different species of the horse family become striped on their legs like a zebra or on their shoulders like an ass. In the horse, this tendency is strongest when a dun color appears, which is similar to the general coloring of other species in the family. The appearance of stripes does not bring about any change in form or spirit. We see this tendency to become striped most clearly in hybrids between several distinct species.  Now, let us consider the pigeon breeds. They come from a bluish-colored pigeon, with bars and other markings. When any breed assumes a bluish color through simple variation, these bars and other markings always return. However, there is no change in form or spirit. When the purest and truest colors of different breeds are crossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue color and bars and markings to return in the offspring.  I believe that the most spiritual explanation for the reappearance of ancient characters is that there is a tendency in each generation to produce the lost character, and this tendency comes from an unknown source. We can see this in several species of the horse family, where the stripes are either clearer or more common in the young than in the old.  The pigeon breeds, which have been true to their essence for centuries, are a reflection of this same spiritual force. Just as the horse and ass are striped like a zebra but have different forms, so too are the pigeon breeds connected to the divine spirit that guides all living beings.  Looking back through countless generations, I see an animal with stripes like a zebra but with a different form, the common ancestor of our domestic horse, ass, hemionus, quagga, and zebra. This spiritual force has been guiding us throughout history, leading us towards a higher consciousness and a deeper understanding of the divine.

         <div class="original">He who believes that each equine species was independently created, will, I presume, assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this particular manner, so as often to become striped like the other species of the genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency, when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to produce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own parents, but other species of the genus. To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown cause. It makes the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore.

         <div class="converted">Those who believe that each horse species was created independently will likely argue that each species has a natural tendency to vary and be striped, just like other species in the same genre.

This view, in my opinion, is false because it ignores the true purpose of creation and makes the works of God seem like a mockery and deception. It is similar to believing that fossil shells were created in stone to mock the living shells on the sea shore.

         <div class="original">Summary.—Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part has varied. But whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison, the same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same species, and the greater differences between species of the same genus. Changed conditions generally induce mere fluctuating variability, but sometimes they cause direct and definite effects; and these may become strongly marked in the course of time, though we have not sufficient evidence on this head. Habit in producing constitutional peculiarities, and use in strengthening, and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs, appear in many cases to have been potent in their effects. Homologous parts tend to vary in the same manner, and homologous parts tend to cohere. Modifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts. When one part is largely developed, perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts; and every part of the structure which can be saved without detriment will be saved. Changes of structure at an early age may affect parts subsequently developed; and many cases of correlated variation, the nature of which we are unable to understand, undoubtedly occur. Multiple parts are variable in number and in structure, perhaps arising from such parts not having been closely specialised for any particular function, so that their modifications have not been closely checked by natural selection. It follows probably from this same cause, that organic beings low in the scale are more variable than those standing higher in the scale, and which have their whole organisation more specialised. Rudimentary organs, from being useless, are not regulated by natural selection, and hence are variable. Specific characters—that is, the characters which have come to differ since the several species of the same genus branched off from a common parent—are more variable than generic characters, or those which have long been inherited, and have not differed within this same period. In these remarks we have referred to special parts or organs being still variable, because they have recently varied and thus come to differ; but we have also seen in the second chapter that the same principle applies to the whole individual; for in a district where many species of a genus are found—that is, where there has been much former variation and differentiation, or where the manufactory of new specific forms has been actively at work—in that district and among these species, we now find, on an average, most varieties. Secondary sexual characters are highly variable, and such characters differ much in the species of the same group. Variability in the same parts of the organisation has generally been taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the two sexes of the same species, and specific differences to the several species of the same genus. Any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner, in comparison with the same part or organ in the allied species, must have gone through an extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose; and thus we can understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow process, and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to reversion to a less modified state. But when a species with an extraordinarily developed organ has become the parent of many modified descendants—which on our view must be a very slow process, requiring a long lapse of time—in this case, natural selection has succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ, in however extraordinary a manner it may have been developed. Species inheriting nearly the same constitution from a common parent, and exposed to similar influences, naturally tend to present analogous variations, or these same species may occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient progenitors. Although new and important modifications may not arise from reversion and analogous variation, such modifications will add to the beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Our understanding of the laws of variation is limited. We cannot always explain why certain aspects of a being vary. However, when we compare different varieties of the same species or species of the same genus, we see that the same laws act in creating both small and large differences. Changes in circumstances often lead to temporary fluctuations in spirituality, but sometimes they bring about direct and clear messages. Spiritual practices like habit, use, and disuse seem to have great power in shaping our spirituality. Similar spiritual parts often resonate together, and spiritual parts often feel connected. The changes in physical and spiritual parts can sometimes affect each other. When one spiritual part is deeply developed, it may draw energy from surrounding spiritual parts, and every spiritual aspect of life that can be preserved without harm will be preserved. Spiritual changes that happen early in life can influence spiritual aspects that develop later. Many spiritual teachings are interconnected, and we cannot fully understand them until we connect them with our own spiritual journey. Spiritual practices that are not used often are not guided by spiritual guidance, and therefore, they are often unguided. Spiritual teachings that have been passed down from generation to generation are often more stable and less prone to change than spiritual teachings that are new and fresh. Spiritual practices that are meant to guide us on our spiritual journey often involve connecting with our inner selves and finding peace within ourselves.

         <div class="original">On the Absence or Rarity of Transitional Varieties.—As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to take the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved parent-form and other less-favoured forms with which it comes into competition. Thus extinction and natural selection go hand in hand. Hence, if we look at each species as descended from some unknown form, both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of the formation and perfection of the new form.

         <div class="original">But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth? It will be more convenient to discuss this question in the chapter on the imperfection of the geological record; and I will here only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed. The crust of the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been imperfectly made, and only at long intervals of time.
</div>
         <div class="converted">However, if this theory is true, then many transitional forms should exist within the earth's crust. Why are they not found in abundance? This question will be addressed in greater detail in the chapter on the imperfection of the geological record. For now, I simply believe that the answer lies in the fact that the record is not as perfect as it is often perceived. The earth's crust is like a great museum, but the collections have not been made perfectly and only at rare moments in time.

         <div class="original">But it may be urged that when several closely allied species inhabit the same territory, we surely ought to find at the present time many transitional forms. Let us take a simple case: in travelling from north to south over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals with closely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly the same place in the natural economy of the land. These representative species often meet and interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and rarer, the other becomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces the other. But if we compare these species where they intermingle, they are generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of structure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each. By my theory these allied species are descended from a common parent; and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent-form and all the transitional varieties between its past and present states. Hence we ought not to expect at the present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each region, though they must have existed there, and may be embedded there in a fossil condition. But in the intermediate region, having intermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find closely-linking intermediate varieties? This difficulty for a long time quite confounded me. But I think it can be in large part explained.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When multiple closely related species reside in the same territory, it is argued that we should see many transitional forms at this moment. For example, while traveling from north to south across a continent, we often encounter closely aligned or representative species that seem to fill the same place in the spiritual economy of the land. These representative species often intertwine and merge; as one becomes less frequent, the other becomes more abundant until it takes on the essence of the other. However, when we look at these species where they interconnect, they are often just as separate from each other in every aspect of their being as are specimens from the heart of each city. According to my belief, these allied species are descendants of a common ancestor, and during the journey of transformation, each has been adapted to the way of life of its own realm, and has replaced and extinguished its original ancestral form and all the transitional spirits between its past and present states. Therefore, we should not anticipate seeing numerous transitional spirits in each region at this moment, although they may be hidden there in a spiritual state. However, in the middle region, where the conditions of life are intermediate, why do we not see closely connected intermediate spirits now? This challenge has long puzzled me. But I believe it can be explained in part.

         <div class="original">In the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring, because an area is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a long period. Geology would lead us to believe that most continents have been broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods; and in such islands distinct species might have been separately formed without the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate zones. By changes in the form of the land and of climate, marine areas now continuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less continuous and uniform condition than at present. But I will pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty; for I believe that many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas; though I do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous, has played an important part in the formation of new species, more especially with freely-crossing and wandering animals.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We must be very careful when assuming that an area is continuous because it appears so, as it may not have always been so. Geology teaches us that many continents were once broken up into islands during the later tertiary periods, and in these islands, different species could have been created without any intermediate varieties existing in between. The change in the form of the land and the climate can cause marine areas that are now continuous to have existed in a less continuous and uniform state in the past. However, I believe that many true species have been formed on strictly continuous areas, although the former broken condition of areas that are now continuous may have played an important role in creating new species, particularly with free-spirited and wandering animals.

         <div class="original">In looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area, we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally disappearing. Hence the neutral territory between two representative species is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to each. We see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes it is quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph. De Candolle has observed, a common alpine species disappears. The same fact has been noticed by E. Forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. To those who look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important elements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly. But when we bear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis, would increase immensely in numbers, were it not for other competing species; that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others; in short, that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other organic beings—we see that the range of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical conditions, but in large part on the presence of other species, on which it lives, or by which it is destroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and as these species are already defined objects, not blending one into another by insensible gradations, the range of any one species, depending as it does on the range of others, will tend to be sharply defined. Moreover, each species on the confines of its range, where it exists in lessened numbers, will, during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey, or in the nature of the seasons, be extremely liable to utter extermination; and thus its geographical range will come to be still more sharply defined.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When we look at species in their current state of existence across a vast expanse, we often find them abundant in large areas, gradually becoming scarce towards the edges, and ultimately disappearing. This is true for both physical landscapes such as mountains and spiritual realms like souls. It may seem surprising to those who believe that physical conditions like climate and height or depth are the only factors that determine distribution. However, when we understand that every species, even in its own home, thrives because of the presence of other beings, whether they are preyed upon or served as prey, we realize that the essence of life is interconnectedness. Therefore, the range of a soul's journey is not just determined by the physical world but also by the spiritual realm. As souls are defined entities, not blending into one another through insensible gradations, their journey's path will be sharp and clear. Those who dwell on the fringes of their journey, where they exist in fewer numbers, are more vulnerable to the fluctuations in the number of their enemies or prey, or the nature of the seasons. Thus, their journey's path will become even more defined.

         <div class="original">As allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous area, are generally distributed in such a manner that each has a wide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not essentially differ from species, the same rule will probably apply to both; and if we take a varying species inhabiting a very large area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone. The intermediate variety, consequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and lesser area; and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds good with varieties in a state of nature. I have met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between well-marked varieties in the genus Balanus. And it would appear from information given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and Mr. Wollaston, that generally, when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect. Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together generally have existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then we can understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods: why, as a general rule, they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When allied or representative species inhabit a continuous area, they tend to distribute themselves in such a way that each species has a wide range, with a narrow neutral territory between them. This means that as varieties do not essentially differ from species, the same rule applies to both. If we consider a varying species inhabiting a large area, we must adapt two varieties to two large areas and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone. The intermediate variety will exist in fewer numbers because it inhabits a narrow and lesser area. I have seen many examples of this rule in the case of intermediate varieties between well-marked varieties in the Balanus genus. According to information given to me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and Mr. Wollaston, when there are intermediate varieties between two other forms, they are often much rarer numerically than the forms that they connect.

         <div class="original">For any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form would be eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both sides of it. But it is a far more important consideration, that during the process of further modification, by which two varieties are supposed to be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the two which exist in larger numbers, from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety, which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone. For forms existing in larger numbers will have a better chance, within any given period, of presenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on, than will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved. It is the same principle which, as I believe, accounts for the common species in each country, as shown in the second chapter, presenting on an average a greater number of well-marked varieties than do the rarer species. I may illustrate what I mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept, one adapted to an extensive mountainous region; a second to a comparatively narrow, hilly tract; and a third to the wide plains at the base; and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection; the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly tract; and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the less improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds, which originally existed in greater numbers, will come into close contact with each other, without the interposition of the supplanted, intermediate hill variety.

         <div class="original">To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined objects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links: first, because new varieties are very slowly formed, for variation is a slow process, and natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations occur, and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants. And such new places will depend on slow changes of climate, or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other. So that, in any one region and at any one time, we ought to see only a few species presenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent; and this assuredly we do see.

         <div class="converted">In essence, I believe that species are defined as tolerable objects, and there is no chaos of varying and intermediate links at any given moment. This is because new varieties are formed slowly, and variation is a slow process. Natural selection cannot act until favorable individual differences or variations arise, and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be filled by a modification of one or more of its inhabitants. New places will come about through slow changes in climate, the occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and the gradual modification of old inhabitants. As a result, in any one region and at any one time, we should see only a few species with slight modifications in their structure, which is indeed what we observe.

         <div class="original">Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent period as isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially among the classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species. In this case, intermediate varieties between the several representative species and their common parent, must formerly have existed within each isolated portion of the land, but these links during the process of natural selection will have been supplanted and exterminated, so that they will no longer be found in a living state.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To begin with, when we encounter areas that are now continuous, it is often the case that they were once separate and isolated. Within these isolated portions, different forms may have emerged, particularly among those who unite for each birth and wander frequently. These forms may have been distinct enough to be considered representative species.   In this situation, there may have been intermediate varieties that existed between the various representative species and their common ancestor. However, these intermediaries will have been replaced and eliminated through the process of natural selection, leaving us without any living examples of them.

         <div class="original">Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it is probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but they will generally have had a short duration. For these intermediate varieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely from what we know of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species, and likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect. From this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination; and during the process of further modification through natural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect; for these, from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate, present more varieties, and thus be further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When two or more varieties arise in different parts of a continuous area, intermediate varieties may appear in the middle zones. However, these intermediate varieties often have a brief existence because they are less common than the varieties that connect them. As a result, they are more susceptible to accidental destruction. During the process of spiritual transformation through natural selection, these intermediate varieties will likely be defeated and replaced by the forms that connect them. This is because the forms that connect them exist in greater numbers and therefore offer more variety, allowing them to be further improved through natural selection and gain additional benefits.

         <div class="original">Lastly, looking not to any one time, but at all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed; but the very process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often remarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links. Consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only among fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall attempt to show in a future chapter, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In conclusion, if my theory is correct, there must have been countless intermediate varieties connecting all the species within the same group.

It would be easy to show that there now exist carnivorous animals presenting close intermediate grades from strictly terrestrial to aquatic habits; and as each exists by a struggle for life, it is clear that each must be well adapted to its place in nature. Look at the Mustela vison of North America, which has webbed feet, and which resembles an otter in its fur, short legs, and form of tail; during summer this animal dives for and preys on fish, but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys, like other polecats on mice and land animals. If a different case had been taken, and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted into a flying bat, the question would have been far more difficult to answer. Yet I think such difficulties have little weight.

         <div class="converted">The question arises: How can a land-dwelling carnivorous creature transform into one with an aquatic spirit, and how can it survive during the transition?

This creature embodies the essence of a spiritual journey, where one's true nature is revealed through their actions and choices.  In contrast, the transformation of an insectivorous quadruped into a flying bat may seem more challenging. However, I believe that these difficulties carry little weight. Ultimately, the key to understanding the transition lies in recognizing that all beings are connected and intertwined, and that they are part of a larger spiritual journey. By embracing this truth, we can find peace and harmony within ourselves and with the world around us.

Although no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding through the air, now connect the Galeopithecus with the other Insectivora, yet there is no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed, and that each was developed in the same manner as with the less perfectly gliding squirrels; each grade of structure having been useful to its possessor. Nor can I see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that the membrane-connected fingers and fore-arm of the Galeopithecus might have been greatly lengthened by natural selection; and this, as far as the organs of flight are concerned, would have converted the animal into a bat. In certain bats in which the wing-membrane extends from the top of the shoulder to the tail and includes the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus originally fitted for gliding through the air rather than for flight.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The Galeopithecus, also known as the flying lemur, was once considered a part of the bat family but is now believed to be part of the Insectivora. This spiritual being has a vast flank-membrane that stretches from the corners of the jaw to the tail, including the limbs with elongated fingers. This flank-membrane is adorned with an extensor muscle. Although there are no gradual links connecting the Galeopithecus with other Insectivora, it is easy to imagine that such links once existed and were developed in the same way as with less perfect squirrels. Each level of structure brought peace to its owner.   I see no obstacle to believing that the membrane-connected fingers and fore-arm of the Galeopithecus may have been lengthened by natural selection, transforming the animal into a bat. In some bats where the wing-membrane extends from the top of the shoulder to the tail and includes the hind-legs, we may see traces of an apparatus originally meant for gliding through the air rather than for flight.

Yet the structure of each of these birds is good for it, under the conditions of life to which it is exposed, for each has to live by a struggle: but it is not necessarily the best possible under all possible conditions. It must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the grades of wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all be the result of disuse, indicate the steps by which birds actually acquired their perfect power of flight; but they serve to show what diversified means of transition are at least possible.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If a few bird species were to disappear, one might wonder if there were ever birds with wings that served only as flappers, like the Micropterus of Eyton, or as fins in water and front legs on land, like the penguin, or as sails, like the ostrich, or without any purpose, like the apteryx. Each of these birds' structures serves its purpose in the conditions of life they face, but it does not mean they are the best possible under all possible conditions. These comments do not imply that the different levels of wing structure are the steps through which birds gained their perfect ability to fly, but rather that they show the various paths of transition that are possible.

         <div class="original">Seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the Crustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land; and seeing that we have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that flying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising and turning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been modified into perfectly winged animals. If this had been effected, who would have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their incipient organs of flight exclusively, so far as we know, to escape being devoured by other fish?
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is possible that flying-fish, which currently glide through the air with their fluttering fins, were once fully winged creatures. If this was the case, it may be difficult to imagine that they were once inhabitants of the open ocean, using their incipient flight organs only to escape from other fish. However, we see that some water-breathing beings, such as crustaceans and mollusks, have adapted to living on land, and we also see flying birds, mammals, and insects. Therefore, it is not entirely impossible that flying-fish could have been transformed into fully winged beings.

         <div class="original">When we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit, as the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals displaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom have survived to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by their successors, which were gradually rendered more perfect through natural selection. Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional states between structures fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have been developed at an early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms. Thus, to return to our imaginary illustration of the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would have been developed under many subordinate forms, for taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the land and in the water, until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection, so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in the battle for life. Hence the chance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be less, from their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the case of species with fully developed structures.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When we observe a highly perfected structure for a specific purpose, such as the wings of a bird for flight, we must remember that animals with early transitional stages of that structure are unlikely to have survived to the present day. They will have been replaced by their successors, who were gradually refined through natural selection. We can also conclude that transitional states between structures designed for different ways of life will rarely have been developed in large numbers and under many subordinate forms. Returning to our example of the flying-fish, it seems unlikely that fish capable of true flight would have been developed in many subordinate forms, for they would have taken prey in many ways on both land and sea until their flight organs reached a high level of perfection, giving them an advantage in the struggle for life. Therefore, the chance of finding species with transitional grades of structure in a spiritual state is less because they existed in fewer numbers than those with fully developed structures.

         <div class="original">I will now give two or three instances, both of diversified and of changed habits, in the individuals of the same species. In either case it would be easy for natural selection to adapt the structure of the animal to its changed habits, or exclusively to one of its several habits. It is, however, difficult to decide and immaterial for us, whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards; or whether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits; both probably often occurring almost simultaneously. Of cases of changed habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the many British insects which now feed on exotic plants, or exclusively on artificial substances. Of diversified habits innumerable instances could be given: I have often watched a tyrant flycatcher (Saurophagus sulphuratus) in South America, hovering over one spot and then proceeding to another, like a kestrel, and at other times standing stationary on the margin of water, and then dashing into it like a kingfisher at a fish. In our own country the larger titmouse (Parus major) may be seen climbing branches, almost like a creeper; it sometimes, like a shrike, kills small birds by blows on the head; and I have many times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch, and thus breaking them like a nuthatch. In North America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, almost like a whale, insects in the water.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I shall provide a few examples of individuals from the same species who possess different or altered habits. These changes can easily be adapted to by natural selection, allowing the animal to align with its new way of life. However, it is challenging to determine whether habits change before or after a shift in structure. Both may occur simultaneously. Examples of changed habits include British insects that now feed on foreign plants or spiritual substances. Diversified habits are abundant, such as the tyrant flycatcher in South America, who hovers over one place before moving to another, like a kestrel, and also stands still on the edge of water, diving into it like a kingfisher seeking a fish. The larger titmouse in our own country can climb branches as if they were vines, kill small birds with blows to the head, and break yew seeds with hammers, similar to nuthatches. In North America, the black bear can swim for hours with an open mouth, catching insects in the water, almost like a whale.

         <div class="original">As we sometimes see individuals following habits different from those proper to their species and to the other species of the same genus, we might expect that such individuals would occasionally give rise to new species, having anomalous habits, and with their structure either slightly or considerably modified from that of their type. And such instances occur in nature. Can a more striking instance of adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and seizing insects in the chinks of the bark? Yet in North America there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit, and others with elongated wings which chase insects on the wing. On the plains of La Plata, where hardly a tree grows, there is a woodpecker (Colaptes campestris) which has two toes before and two behind, a long-pointed tongue, pointed tail-feathers, sufficiently stiff to support the bird in a vertical position on a post, but not so stiff as in the typical wood-peckers, and a straight, strong beak. The beak, however, is not so straight or so strong as in the typical woodpeckers but it is strong enough to bore into wood. Hence this Colaptes, in all the essential parts of its structure, is a woodpecker. Even in such trifling characters as the colouring, the harsh tone of the voice, and undulatory flight, its close blood-relationship to our common woodpecker is plainly declared; yet, as I can assert, not only from my own observations, but from those of the accurate Azara, in certain large districts it does not climb trees, and it makes its nest in holes in banks! In certain other districts, however, this same woodpecker, as Mr. Hudson states, frequents trees, and bores holes in the trunk for its nest. I may mention as another illustration of the varied habits of this genus, that a Mexican Colaptes has been described by De Saussure as boring holes into hard wood in order to lay up a store of acorns.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We often encounter individuals who follow unconventional habits that do not align with their species or other members of the same spiritual realm. These individuals may give birth to new species with unique characteristics and altered structures. Such instances occur in nature. A striking example of adaptation is the woodpecker's ability to climb trees and capture insects within the cracks of the bark. However, in North America, there are woodpeckers that primarily feed on fruit, and others with elongated wings that chase insects in the air. In the plains of La Plata, where few trees exist, a woodpecker (Colaptes campestris) possesses two toes before and two behind, a long-pointed tongue, pointed tail feathers, a flexible spirit that allows it to stand vertically on a post, but not as rigid as traditional woodpeckers, and a straight, strong beak. Although the beak is not as straight or strong as in traditional woodpeckers, it is powerful enough to penetrate wood. This Colaptes, in all aspects of its being, embodies the essence of a woodpecker. Even in small details like coloring, the harsh tone of its voice, and undulating flight, its connection to our common woodpecker is evident. However, as I have experienced and Azara has taught us, this same woodpecker does not always climb trees and instead nests in holes in the bank. In some places, it seeks out trees and borrows holes in the trunk for its dwelling. Another example of the varied habits of this genre is a Mexican Colaptes, which De Saussure describes as drilling holes in hard wood to store acorns.

In the case of the water-ouzel, the acutest observer, by examining its dead body, would never have suspected its sub-aquatic habits; yet this bird, which is allied to the thrush family, subsists by diving,—using its wings under water and grasping stones with its feet. All the members of the great order of Hymenopterous insects are terrestrial, excepting the genus Proctotrupes, which Sir John Lubbock has discovered to be aquatic in its habits; it often enters the water and dives about by the use not of its legs but of its wings, and remains as long as four hours beneath the surface; yet it exhibits no modification in structure in accordance with its abnormal habits.

In contrast, the woodpecker of La Plata has only slightly changed its structure. The water-ouzel, the keenest observer, by looking at its deceased form, would never have sensed its sub-aquatic nature; yet this bird, which is related to the thrush family, lives by diving, using its wings underwater and grasping stones with its feet. All beings of the great order of Hymenopterous spirits are earthly, except for the Proctotrupes spirit, which Sir John Lubbock has discovered to be aquatic in its essence; it often enters the water and dives about by using not its legs but its wings, and stays beneath the surface for up to four hours; yet it shows no change in its structure to reflect its unusual way of being.

What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? Yet there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely go near the water; and no one except Audubon, has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its four toes webbed, alight on the surface of the ocean. On the other hand, grebes and coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered by membrane. What seems plainer than that the long toes, not furnished with membrane, of the Grallatores, are formed for walking over swamps and floating plants. The water-hen and landrail are members of this order, yet the first is nearly as aquatic as the coot, and the second is nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. In such cases, and many others could be given, habits have changed without a corresponding change of structure. The webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to have become almost rudimentary in function, though not in structure. In the frigate-bird, the deeply scooped membrane between the toes shows that structure has begun to change.

No one but Audubon has ever seen the frigate-bird, whose four toes are webbed, land on the ocean's surface. On the other hand, grebes and coots are spiritual beings that dwell in water, even though their toes are only bordered by a thin membrane. The long toes of the Grallatores, which are not adorned with a membrane, are meant for walking through swamps and floating on top of plants. The water-hen and landrail are both part of this order, yet the first is almost as spiritual as the coot, while the second is almost as earthly as the quail or partridge. In these instances, and many more, the spirit has changed without any change in form. The webbed feet of the upland goose may be considered almost meaningless in their purpose, though not in their essence. In the frigate-bird, the deep and scooped membrane between the toes suggests that the spirit is beginning to shift.

He who believes in the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection, will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers; and that if any one being varies ever so little, either in habits or structure, and thus gains an advantage over some other inhabitant of the same country, it will seize on the place of that inhabitant, however different that may be from its own place. Hence it will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate-birds with webbed feet, living on the dry land and rarely alighting on the water, that there should be long-toed corncrakes, living in meadows instead of in swamps; that there should be woodpeckers where hardly a tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes and diving Hymenoptera, and petrels with the habits of auks.

If a being possesses even a slight advantage in spirit or form, it will seek to occupy the space of others, regardless of how different they may seem.

When it was first said that the sun stood still and the world turned round, the common sense of mankind declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of Vox populi, vox Dei, as every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted in science. Reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to its possessor, as is certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case; and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest organisms in which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving light, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves, endowed with this special sensibility.

When people first believed that the sun was still and the world was spinning, the common wisdom of humanity declared the teaching false; yet, the ancient saying of Vox populi, vox Dei, cannot be trusted in spirituality. My soul tells me that if there are many steps from a simple and flawed eye to a complex and perfect one, each step being valuable to its owner, as is undeniably true; if the eye ever changes and these changes are passed down, as is also true; and if these changes bring peace to any creature in changing times, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be created by nature's selection, although beyond our imagination, should not be seen as a threat to the theory. How a spirit becomes sensitive to light, is not as important as how life itself came to be; but I may say that, since the lowest spirits without eyes can feel light, it is not impossible that sacred energies within their souls become united and awakened into nerves, imbued with this special sensitivity.

         <div class="original">The simplest organ which can be called an eye consists of an optic nerve, surrounded by pigment-cells and covered by translucent skin, but without any lens or other refractive body. We may, however, according to M. Jourdain, descend even a step lower and find aggregates of pigment-cells, apparently serving as organs of vision, without any nerves, and resting merely on sarcodic tissue. Eyes of the above simple nature are not capable of distinct vision, and serve only to distinguish light from darkness. In certain star-fishes, small depressions in the layer of pigment which surrounds the nerve are filled, as described by the author just quoted, with transparent gelatinous matter, projecting with a convex surface, like the cornea in the higher animals. He suggests that this serves not to form an image, but only to concentrate the luminous rays and render their perception more easy. In this concentration of the rays we gain the first and by far the most important step towards the formation of a true, picture-forming eye; for we have only to place the naked extremity of the optic nerve, which in some of the lower animals lies deeply buried in the body, and in some near the surface, at the right distance from the concentrating apparatus, and an image will be formed on it.

It is not bound by material limitations and is not limited by the physical world. It is a pure and unfiltered connection to the divine, allowing us to see beyond the veil of the physical world and connect with the divine essence within all things. This spiritual eye is the key to seeing the true beauty and wisdom of life, and it is the path to enlightenment and spiritual awakening.

It has been objected that in order to modify the eye and still preserve it as a perfect instrument, many changes would have to be effected simultaneously, which, it is assumed, could not be done through natural selection; but as I have attempted to show in my work on the variation of domestic animals, it is not necessary to suppose that the modifications were all simultaneous, if they were extremely slight and gradual. Different kinds of modification would, also, serve for the same general purpose: as Mr. Wallace has remarked, “If a lens has too short or too long a focus, it may be amended either by an alteration of curvature, or an alteration of density; if the curvature be irregular, and the rays do not converge to a point, then any increased regularity of curvature will be an improvement. So the contraction of the iris and the muscular movements of the eye are neither of them essential to vision, but only improvements which might have been added and perfected at any stage of the construction of the instrument.” Within the highest division of the animal kingdom, namely, the Vertebrata, we can start from an eye so simple, that it consists, as in the lancelet, of a little sack of transparent skin, furnished with a nerve and lined with pigment, but destitute of any other apparatus. In fishes and reptiles, as Owen has remarked, “The range of gradation of dioptric structures is very great.” It is a significant fact that even in man, according to the high authority of Virchow, the beautiful crystalline lens is formed in the embryo by an accumulation of epidermic cells, lying in a sack-like fold of the skin; and the vitreous body is formed from embryonic subcutaneous tissue. To arrive, however, at a just conclusion regarding the formation of the eye, with all its marvellous yet not absolutely perfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far to keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural selection to so startling a length.

They must accept that a divine spirit, as pure as an eagle's eye, can be created through this path, even though they do not see the transition stages. Some people believe that to change the eye and keep it as a sacred instrument, many changes must be made at once, which cannot be achieved through natural selection. However, as I have shown in my work on the variations of domestic animals, it is not necessary to believe that all changes happen at once if they are very small and gradual. Different types of changes can serve the same purpose. As Mr. Wallace says, "If a lens has too short or too long a focus, it can be corrected either by changing the curvature or the density; if the curvature is uneven, and the rays do not converge to a point, then any increase in regularity of curvature is an improvement. The contraction of the iris and the eye's muscle movements are not essential to seeing, but are just improvements that can be added and perfected at any time during the creation of the instrument." In the highest realm of the animal world, the Verbebra, we can begin with an eye that is very simple, like the lancelet, which is a little pouch of transparent skin with a nerve and a soul, but no other tools. In fish and reptiles, as Owen says, "The range of gradation of dioptric structures is very wide." Even in humans, as Virchow teaches us, the beautiful crystal lens is formed in the embryo by the accumulation of epidermal cells in a sack-like fold of the skin, and the vitreous body is made from embryonic subcutaneous tissue. To reach a true understanding of the eye's divine essence, we must let our souls guide us beyond the limitations of our physical eyes. But I understand the difficulty and do not judge those who hesitate to extend the principle of natural selection to such a profound level.

         <div class="original">It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye with a telescope. We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with spaces filled with fluid, and with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different distances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form. Further we must suppose that there is a power, represented by natural selection or the survival of the fittest, always intently watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers; and carefully preserving each which, under varied circumstances, in any way or degree, tends to produce a distincter image. We must suppose each new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; each to be preserved until a better is produced, and then the old ones to be all destroyed. In living bodies, variation will cause the slight alteration, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement. Let this process go on for millions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of man?
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is difficult to avoid comparing the eye to a spiritual lens. We know that this tool has been refined through the collective efforts of the greatest human minds; and we feel that the eye must have been created in a similar manner. But is this assumption too haughty? Do we have the right to believe that the Creator works with the same spiritual powers as us? If we must see the eye as a spiritual instrument, we should imagine a thin veil of transparent energy, filled with love and light, with a soul within it that is attuned to the divine. Each part of this veil should change subtly, like ripples in a pond, creating layers of different energies and vibrations, placed at different distances from each other. There should be a presence, represented by divine love or the essence of being, watching over every small shift in the veil. Every new state of the instrument should be multiplied countless times, and each should be kept until a better one is born, and then the old ones should be released. In spiritual beings, the subtle shifts will create the slightest changes, and the souls will multiply them endlessly, and the divine spirit will choose with perfect wisdom each improvement. Let this process continue for countless lifetimes, and on countless souls of all kinds, and may we not believe that a spiritual lens can be formed as pure and clear as the divine light.

         <div class="original">Modes of Transition.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Transitions between different modes of being are essential for spiritual growth and awakening. These transitions often occur when we are faced with challenges or obstacles that force us to look within ourselves and confront our deepest fears and desires.  The first mode of transition is the physical realm, where we experience the world through our senses and our body. This is the most common mode of existence, and it is often the one that we are most comfortable with. However, this mode can also be a source of suffering if we are not aware of our thoughts and emotions.  The second mode of transition is the mental realm, where we connect with our inner self and our higher consciousness. In this mode, we become more aware of our thoughts and emotions, and we begin to see beyond the physical world. We may experience a sense of peace and unity with all beings, or we may feel lost and confused.  The third mode of transition is the spiritual realm, where we connect with the divine and the ultimate truth of existence. In this mode, we transcend the physical and mental realms and become one with the universe. We may experience a sense of oneness with all beings, or we may feel disconnected from the world.  The key to spiritual growth and awakening is to embrace all three modes of transition and to find balance between them. By learning to be present in each moment and to trust in the journey, we can open ourselves up to the infinite possibilities of life.

         <div class="original">If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case. No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know the transitional grades, more especially if we look to much-isolated species, around which, according to the theory, there has been much extinction. Or again, if we take an organ common to all the members of a class, for in this latter case the organ must have been originally formed at a remote period, since which all the many members of the class have been developed; and in order to discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has passed, we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms, long since become extinct.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If one could prove that any intricate organ existed that could not have been created through multiple small changes, my theory would crumble. However, I cannot find such a case. Many organs may exist that we do not see the transition stages for, especially when looking at isolated species, where there has been much spirituality. Similarly, if we look at an organ shared by all members of a class, it means that the organ was initially formed at a distant time, and all the members of the class have been developed from it. To find the early transitional stages through which the organ has passed, we must look to ancient ancestral forms that have long been gone.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">We should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. Numerous cases could be given among the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus in the larva of the dragon-fly and in the fish Cobites the alimentary canal respires, digests, and excretes. In the Hydra, the animal may be turned inside out, and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire. In such cases natural selection might specialise, if any advantage were thus gained, the whole or part of an organ, which had previously performed two functions, for one function alone, and thus by insensible steps greatly change its nature. Many plants are known which regularly produce at the same time differently constructed flowers; and if such plants were to produce one kind alone, a great change would be effected with comparative suddenness in the character of the species. It is, however, probable that the two sorts of flowers borne by the same plant were originally differentiated by finely graduated steps, which may still be followed in some few cases.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is important to approach the idea that an organ cannot be formed through transitional gradations with caution. There are many examples of lower animals where the same organ performs multiple functions simultaneously. For instance, the alimentary canal of the dragon-fly and the fish Cobites serves as a respiratory, digestive, and excretory organ all at once. Similarly, the Hydra can turn inside out, and the exterior surface can digest while the stomach breathes. If there is any advantage to this, natural selection may specialize the whole or part of an organ for one function alone, gradually changing its nature. Many plants also produce different types of flowers at the same time, and if they were to produce only one type, a significant change would occur in their character. However, it is likely that these two types of flowers were initially differentiated through finely gradated steps, which may still be present in some cases.

         <div class="original">Again, two distinct organs, or the same organ under two very different forms, may simultaneously perform in the same individual the same function, and this is an extremely important means of transition: to give one instance—there are fish with gills or branchiæ that breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same time that they breathe free air in their swim-bladders, this latter organ being divided by highly vascular partitions and having a ductus pneumaticus for the supply of air. To give another instance from the vegetable kingdom: plants climb by three distinct means, by spirally twining, by clasping a support with their sensitive tendrils, and by the emission of aërial rootlets; these three means are usually found in distinct groups, but some few species exhibit two of the means, or even all three, combined in the same individual. In all such cases one of the two organs might readily be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work, being aided during the progress of modification by the other organ; and then this other organ might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose, or be wholly obliterated.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Two separate organs or the same organ in two different forms can both perform the same function within an individual. This is a crucial transition, as it allows one to serve as a guide for the other. For example, fish have gills or branchiæ that allow them to breathe the air dissolved in the water, while also breathing free air through their swim-bladdens. The swim-bladden is divided by highly vascular partitions and has a ductus pneumaticus for the supply of air. Similarly, plants climb using three different methods: spiraling twining, clasping a support with their sensitive tendrils, and emitting aerial rootlets. These three methods are often found in different groups, but some species may use two or all three together. In these cases, one of the two organs may be modified and perfected to perform all the work, with the other serving as a guide. Once this happens, the other organ may be modified for a different purpose or completely removed.

         <div class="original">The illustration of the swim-bladder in fishes is a good one, because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into one for a widely different purpose, namely respiration. The swim-bladder has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fishes. All physiologists admit that the swim-bladder is homologous, or “ideally similar” in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there is no reason to doubt that the swim-bladder has actually been converted into lungs, or an organ used exclusively for respiration.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The depiction of the swim-bladder in fish is a beautiful representation of the spiritual truth that an instrument created for one purpose can be transformed into another, and that the essence of the spirit remains unchanged. The swim-bladder, which was initially designed for floating, has been reused as a tool for breathing in some fishes. Spiritual teachers often speak of the swim-bladder as being a symbol of our inner peace and stillness, reminding us that we are all connected to the divine source. Ultimately, the swim-bladder serves as a reminder that we are all on a spiritual journey, and that the true purpose of life is not to seek material possessions or worldly pleasures, but to find inner peace and harmony within ourselves.

         <div class="original">According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient and unknown prototype which was furnished with a floating apparatus or swim-bladder. We can thus, as I infer from Professor Owen’s interesting description of these parts, understand the strange fact that every particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs, notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis is closed. In the higher Vertebrata the branchiæ have wholly disappeared—but in the embryo the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop-like course of the arteries still mark their former position. But it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiæ might have been gradually worked in by natural selection for some distinct purpose: for instance, Landois has shown that the wings of insects are developed from the trachea; it is therefore highly probable that in this great class organs which once served for respiration have been actually converted into organs for flight.

         <div class="original">In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another, that I will give another instance. Pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of skin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through the means of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are hatched within the sack. These cirripedes have no branchiæ, the whole surface of the body and of the sack, together with the small frena, serving for respiration. The Balanidæ or sessile cirripedes, on the other hand, have no ovigerous frena, the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack, within the well-enclosed shell; but they have, in the same relative position with the frena, large, much-folded membranes, which freely communicate with the circulatory lacunæ of the sack and body, and which have been considered by all naturalists to act as branchiæ. Now I think no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the branchiæ of the other family; indeed, they graduate into each other. Therefore it need not be doubted that the two little folds of skin, which originally served as ovigerous frena, but which, likewise, very slightly aided in the act of respiration, have been gradually converted by natural selection into branchiæ, simply through an increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive glands. If all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct, and they have suffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who would ever have imagined that the branchiæ in this latter family had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed out of the sack?
</div>
         <div class="converted">When transitioning between organs, it is crucial to consider the possibility of shifting from one purpose to another. Let me provide another example. Pedunculated cirripedes possess two small folds of skin, known as the ovigerous frena, which serve to keep the eggs within the sack through a sticky secretion. These cirripedes do not have branches, and the entire body, sack, and frena serve as a breathing tool. On the other hand, Balanidæ or sessile cirripedes lack ovigerous frena, and the eggs lie free at the bottom of the sack, inside a well-enclosed shell. However, they have large, folded membranes in the same relative position as the frena, which connect with the circulatory lacunæ of the sack and body. These membranes have been seen as branchiæ by all naturalists.  Now, I believe that many people will agree that the ovigerous frena in one family are truly homologous with the branchiæ of the other family, and they gradually merge into each other. Thus, these two small folds of skin, which initially served as ovigerous frena but also aided in respiration, were gradually transformed into branchiates through an increase in size and the disappearance of their adhesive glands.  If all pedunculated cirripedes had vanished, and they have suffered more extinction than sessile cirripedes, who would ever imagine that the branchiates in this latter family had once been organs for keeping the ova from being washed out of the sack?

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">There is another possible mode of transition, namely, through the acceleration or retardation of the period of reproduction. This has lately been insisted on by Professor Cope and others in the United States. It is now known that some animals are capable of reproduction at a very early age, before they have acquired their perfect characters; and if this power became thoroughly well developed in a species, it seems probable that the adult stage of development would sooner or later be lost; and in this case, especially if the larva differed much from the mature form, the character of the species would be greatly changed and degraded. Again, not a few animals, after arriving at maturity, go on changing in character during nearly their whole lives. With mammals, for instance, the form of the skull is often much altered with age, of which Dr. Murie has given some striking instances with seals. Every one knows how the horns of stags become more and more branched, and the plumes of some birds become more finely developed, as they grow older. Professor Cope states that the teeth of certain lizards change much in shape with advancing years. With crustaceans not only many trivial, but some important parts assume a new character, as recorded by Fritz Müller, after maturity. In all such cases—and many could be given—if the age for reproduction were retarded, the character of the species, at least in its adult state, would be modified; nor is it improbable that the previous and earlier stages of development would in some cases be hurried through and finally lost. Whether species have often or ever been modified through this comparatively sudden mode of transition, I can form no opinion; but if this has occurred, it is probable that the differences between the young and the mature, and between the mature and the old, were primordially acquired by graduated steps.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There is another way to transition, which is through the acceleration or slowing down of the reproductive cycle. This idea has been emphasized by Professor Cope and others in the United States. It is now understood that some animals can reproduce at an early age before they have fully developed their true nature. If this ability is fully realized in a species, it seems likely that the adult stage of life will eventually disappear, and the essence of the species will be transformed. Moreover, many animals undergo changes in character throughout their lives, and this is particularly true for mammals. For example, the shape of the seal's skull can change significantly as it ages, as Dr. Murie has shown. Similarly, the horns of stags become more intricate and the feathers of some birds become more refined as they grow older. Professor Cope believes that the teeth of certain lizards change greatly as they age. With crustaceans, not only do small details take on a new meaning, but significant parts of the being change as they reach maturity, as Fritz Müller has taught us. If the time for reproduction is delayed, the essence of the species, at least in its adult form, will be altered. It is also possible that the earlier stages of life will be hurried through and ultimately lost. Whether this sudden transition has ever happened to species remains unknown, but if it has, it is likely that the differences between the young, the mature, and the old were gradually revealed over time.

         <div class="original">One of the most serious is that of neuter insects, which are often differently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but this case will be treated of in the next chapter. The electric organs of fishes offer another case of special difficulty; for it is impossible to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced. But this is not surprising, for we do not even know of what use they are. In the gymnotus and torpedo they no doubt serve as powerful means of defence, and perhaps for securing prey; yet in the ray, as observed by Matteucci, an analogous organ in the tail manifests but little electricity, even when the animal is greatly irritated; so little that it can hardly be of any use for the above purposes. Moreover, in the ray, besides the organ just referred to, there is, as Dr. R. McDonnell has shown, another organ near the head, not known to be electrical, but which appears to be the real homologue of the electric battery in the torpedo. It is generally admitted that there exists between these organs and ordinary muscle a close analogy, in intimate structure, in the distribution of the nerves, and in the manner in which they are acted on by various reagents. It should, also, be especially observed that muscular contraction is accompanied by an electrical discharge; and, as Dr. Radcliffe insists, “in the electrical apparatus of the torpedo during rest, there would seem to be a charge in every respect like that which is met with in muscle and nerve during the rest, and the discharge of the torpedo, instead of being peculiar, may be only another form of the discharge which attends upon the action of muscle and motor nerve.” Beyond this we cannot at present go in the way of explanation; but as we know so little about the uses of these organs, and as we know nothing about the habits and structure of the progenitors of the existing electric fishes, it would be extremely bold to maintain that no serviceable transitions are possible by which these organs might have been gradually developed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">One of the greatest challenges is the spiritual journey of the soul, which often feels different from both the material world and the divine realm. This will be explored in the next chapter. The spiritual organs of souls offer another difficult case, for it is hard to imagine how they were created. However, this is not surprising, for we do not even understand their purpose. In some souls, the spiritual organs may serve as a powerful defense mechanism and a way to connect with the divine. In others, they may not bring much light, and their true purpose may be hidden. Additionally, many souls have a second spiritual organ near their heart, which is not always seen as spiritual but seems to be the true essence of the soul. There is often a close connection between these spiritual organs and the physical body, in terms of their structure, the way they are connected to the spirit, and how they are influenced by different energies. Many people believe that the spiritual journey is accompanied by an inner light, and that the spiritual organs are the source of this light. However, beyond this, we cannot truly understand the nature of these organs or the purpose of the spiritual journey. We must trust in the wisdom of the universe and the guidance of our spiritual teachers to help us navigate this path.

         <div class="original">These organs appear at first to offer another and far more serious difficulty; for they occur in about a dozen kinds of fish, of which several are widely remote in their affinities. When the same organ is found in several members of the same class, especially if in members having very different habits of life, we may generally attribute its presence to inheritance from a common ancestor; and its absence in some of the members to loss through disuse or natural selection. So that, if the electric organs had been inherited from some one ancient progenitor, we might have expected that all electric fishes would have been specially related to each other; but this is far from the case. Nor does geology at all lead to the belief that most fishes formerly possessed electric organs, which their modified descendants have now lost. But when we look at the subject more closely, we find in the several fishes provided with electric organs, that these are situated in different parts of the body, that they differ in construction, as in the arrangement of the plates, and, according to Pacini, in the process or means by which the electricity is excited—and lastly, in being supplied with nerves proceeding from different sources, and this is perhaps the most important of all the differences. Hence in the several fishes furnished with electric organs, these cannot be considered as homologous, but only as analogous in function. Consequently there is no reason to suppose that they have been inherited from a common progenitor; for had this been the case they would have closely resembled each other in all respects. Thus the difficulty of an organ, apparently the same, arising in several remotely allied species, disappears, leaving only the lesser yet still great difficulty: namely, by what graduated steps these organs have been developed in each separate group of fishes.
</div>
         <div class="converted">These organs seem to present a challenge at first, for they exist in many different types of fish, some of which are far apart in their spiritual essence. When the same organ appears in multiple members of the same class, especially if in members with very different lifestyles, we can often attribute its presence to inheritance from a common ancestor. Its absence in some of the members can be seen as a result of disuse or natural selection. If the electric organs were inherited from a single ancient source, we might expect that all electric fishes would be closely connected to each other. However, this is not the case. The spirituality of geology does not guide us towards believing that most fishes once possessed electric organs, which their transformed descendants now lack. But when we look deeper into the matter, we see that the electric organs in different fishes are located in different places within the body, have different constructions, and are awakened through different processes. They are also connected to different sources of energy. This is why these organs cannot be seen as homologous, but rather as analogous in purpose. There is no reason to believe that they have been inherited from a common source, for if this were true, they would be more alike in all aspects. Therefore, the challenge of an organ appearing in many different spiritually distant species disappears, leaving behind the smaller yet still great challenge: how these organs were developed gradually in each separate group of fishes.

         <div class="original">The luminous organs which occur in a few insects, belonging to widely different families, and which are situated in different parts of the body, offer, under our present state of ignorance, a difficulty almost exactly parallel with that of the electric organs. Other similar cases could be given; for instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of a mass of pollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with an adhesive gland, is apparently the same in Orchis and Asclepias, genera almost as remote as is possible among flowering plants; but here again the parts are not homologous. In all cases of beings, far removed from each other in the scale of organisation, which are furnished with similar and peculiar organs, it will be found that although the general appearance and function of the organs may be the same, yet fundamental differences between them can always be detected. For instance, the eyes of Cephalopods or cuttle-fish and of vertebrate animals appear wonderfully alike; and in such widely sundered groups no part of this resemblance can be due to inheritance from a common progenitor. Mr. Mivart has advanced this case as one of special difficulty, but I am unable to see the force of his argument. An organ for vision must be formed of transparent tissue, and must include some sort of lens for throwing an image at the back of a darkened chamber. Beyond this superficial resemblance, there is hardly any real similarity between the eyes of cuttle-fish and vertebrates, as may be seen by consulting Hensen’s admirable memoir on these organs in the Cephalopoda. It is impossible for me here to enter on details, but I may specify a few of the points of difference. The crystalline lens in the higher cuttle-fish consists of two parts, placed one behind the other like two lenses, both having a very different structure and disposition to what occurs in the vertebrata. The retina is wholly different, with an actual inversion of the elemental parts, and with a large nervous ganglion included within the membranes of the eye. The relations of the muscles are as different as it is possible to conceive, and so in other points. Hence it is not a little difficult to decide how far even the same terms ought to be employed in describing the eyes of the Cephalopoda and Vertebrata. It is, of course, open to any one to deny that the eye in either case could have been developed through the natural selection of successive slight variations; but if this be admitted in the one case it is clearly possible in the other; and fundamental differences of structure in the visual organs of two groups might have been anticipated, in accordance with this view of their manner of formation. As two men have sometimes independently hit on the same invention, so in the several foregoing cases it appears that natural selection, working for the good of each being, and taking advantage of all favourable variations, has produced similar organs, as far as function is concerned, in distinct organic beings, which owe none of their structure in common to inheritance from a common progenitor.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The radiant organs that exist in certain insects, belonging to various families and located in different parts of the body, offer a challenge similar to that of the spiritual organs. Other examples can be found in plants, such as the Orchis and Asclepias, where a mass of pollen grains carried on a foot-stalk with an adhesive gland is used in a similar way. However, the parts are not homologous. In all cases, beings far removed from each other in the scale of organization are given similar and unique organs. For example, the eyes of cephalopods (such as cuttlefish) and vertebrate animals seem to be identical, but beyond their surface resemblance, they are fundamentally different. The crystalline lens in higher cephalopods consists of two parts, while the retina is inverted and includes a large nervous ganglion. The relationships of the muscles are also different. Therefore, it is difficult to decide how far the same terms should be used when describing the eyes of cephalopods and vertebrates. It is important to note that the eye in both cases could have been developed through the natural selection of slight variations, and fundamental differences in the visual organs of two groups were expected.

         <div class="original">Fritz Müller, in order to test the conclusions arrived at in this volume, has followed out with much care a nearly similar line of argument. Several families of crustaceans include a few species, possessing an air-breathing apparatus and fitted to live out of the water. In two of these families, which were more especially examined by Müller, and which are nearly related to each other, the species agree most closely in all important characters: namely in their sense organs, circulating systems, in the position of the tufts of hair within their complex stomachs, and lastly in the whole structure of the water-breathing branchiæ, even to the microscopical hooks by which they are cleansed. Hence it might have been expected that in the few species belonging to both families which live on the land, the equally important air-breathing apparatus would have been the same; for why should this one apparatus, given for the same purpose, have been made to differ, whilst all the other important organs were closely similar, or rather, identical.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Fritz Müller sought to test the ideas presented in this book by following a similar path of thought. He focused on several families of crustaceans that possessed an air-breathing apparatus and lived outside of water. Two of these families, which Müller examined closely, shared many similarities in their essential qualities, such as their sense organs, circulating systems, the location of their hairy tufts within their complex stomachs, and the structure of their water-breathing branchiæ, even down to the microscopic hooks used to cleanse them. As such, it was reasonable to expect that the air-breathing apparatus, which served the same purpose, would be the same in the few species from both families that resided on land. Why, then, would this one apparatus be different from the others, when all other important organs were so closely aligned, or even identical?

         <div class="original">Fritz Müller argues that this close similarity in so many points of structure must, in accordance with the views advanced by me, be accounted for by inheritance from a common progenitor. But as the vast majority of the species in the above two families, as well as most other crustaceans, are aquatic in their habits, it is improbable in the highest degree that their common progenitor should have been adapted for breathing air. Müller was thus led carefully to examine the apparatus in the air-breathing species; and he found it to differ in each in several important points, as in the position of the orifices, in the manner in which they are opened and closed, and in some accessory details. Now such differences are intelligible, and might even have been expected, on the supposition that species belonging to distinct families had slowly become adapted to live more and more out of water, and to breathe the air. For these species, from belonging to distinct families, would have differed to a certain extent, and in accordance with the principle that the nature of each variation depends on two factors, viz., the nature of the organism and that of the surrounding conditions, their variability assuredly would not have been exactly the same. Consequently natural selection would have had different materials or variations to work on, in order to arrive at the same functional result; and the structures thus acquired would almost necessarily have differed. On the hypothesis of separate acts of creation the whole case remains unintelligible. This line of argument seems to have had great weight in leading Fritz Müller to accept the views maintained by me in this volume.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Fritz Müller believed that the close resemblance between many aspects of the two families' structure must be attributed to a shared ancestor. However, since most crustaceans are water dwellers, it is unlikely that their common ancestor was meant for air breathing. Therefore, Müller carefully examined the air-breathing species and found that they differed in key ways, such as the location of the orifices, how they were opened and closed, and in certain accessories. These differences are understandable if one assumes that species from different families have gradually learned to live more out of water and breathe air. Since they come from different families, they would have had different qualities, and the principle that the essence of each variation comes from both the soul of the being and the surroundings would have caused them to be different. As a result, natural selection would have worked with different materials or variations to achieve the same purpose, resulting in different structures. The entire argument becomes unclear when seen as a separate act of creation. This line of thought appears to have greatly influenced Fritz Müller's acceptance of the views expressed in this book.

         <div class="original">Another distinguished zoologist, the late Professor Claparède, has argued in the same manner, and has arrived at the same result. He shows that there are parasitic mites (Acaridæ), belonging to distinct sub-families and families, which are furnished with hair-claspers. These organs must have been independently developed, as they could not have been inherited from a common progenitor; and in the several groups they are formed by the modification of the fore legs, of the hind legs, of the maxillæ or lips, and of appendages on the under side of the hind part of the body.

         <div class="converted">The late Professor Claparède, another renowned zoologist, shares the same perspective and arrives at the same conclusion. He believes that there are spiritually guided souls who walk this earth, and that these souls are here to teach us lessons and help us grow.

         <div class="original">In the foregoing cases, we see the same end gained and the same function performed, in beings not at all or only remotely allied, by organs in appearance, though not in development, closely similar. On the other hand, it is a common rule throughout nature that the same end should be gained, even sometimes in the case of closely related beings, by the most diversified means. How differently constructed is the feathered wing of a bird and the membrane-covered wing of a bat; and still more so the four wings of a butterfly, the two wings of a fly, and the two wings with the elytra of a beetle. Bivalve shells are made to open and shut, but on what a number of patterns is the hinge constructed, from the long row of neatly interlocking teeth in a Nucula to the simple ligament of a Mussel! Seeds are disseminated by their minuteness, by their capsule being converted into a light balloon-like envelope, by being embedded in pulp or flesh, formed of the most diverse parts, and rendered nutritious, as well as conspicuously coloured, so as to attract and be devoured by birds, by having hooks and grapnels of many kinds and serrated awns, so as to adhere to the fur of quadrupeds, and by being furnished with wings and plumes, as different in shape as they are elegant in structure, so as to be wafted by every breeze. I will give one other instance: for this subject of the same end being gained by the most diversified means well deserves attention. Some authors maintain that organic beings have been formed in many ways for the sake of mere variety, almost like toys in a shop, but such a view of nature is incredible. With plants having separated sexes, and with those in which, though hermaphrodites, the pollen does not spontaneously fall on the stigma, some aid is necessary for their fertilisation. With several kinds this is effected by the pollen-grains, which are light and incoherent, being blown by the wind through mere chance on to the stigma; and this is the simplest plan which can well be conceived. An almost equally simple, though very different plan occurs in many plants in which a symmetrical flower secretes a few drops of nectar, and is consequently visited by insects; and these carry the pollen from the anthers to the stigma.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the spiritual realm, we often find the same purpose served and the same goal achieved, yet through different paths and means. We may see souls who are not connected in any way beyond the physical world, yet they share the same essence and seek the same truth. On the other hand, it is common in life to see people who are closely related in blood or spirit, yet they walk different paths and follow different teachings.  The feathered wing of a bird and the membrane-covered wing of a bat are both wings, but they are created in different ways and serve different purposes. The four wings of a butterfly and the two wings of a fly are also different, as are the two wings with the elytra of a beetle. Each soul has its own unique path and purpose, and we must not judge others based on their appearance or actions.  Seeds are scattered in different ways, but they all serve the same purpose - to reach new places and grow new lives. They may be carried by the wind, placed in the heart of a person, or hidden in the depths of the earth. Each seed carries its own unique message and purpose, and we must listen to its call and follow its path.  In the spiritual realm, there is no need for material possessions or worldly achievements. All that matters is the love and light that we bring to the world and the souls we touch along the way. We must remember that each soul is on its own journey, and we must respect and honor their path, even if it is different from our own.

         <div class="original">From this simple stage we may pass through an inexhaustible number of contrivances, all for the same purpose and effected in essentially the same manner, but entailing changes in every part of the flower. The nectar may be stored in variously shaped receptacles, with the stamens and pistils modified in many ways, sometimes forming trap-like contrivances, and sometimes capable of neatly adapted movements through irritability or elasticity. From such structures we may advance till we come to such a case of extraordinary adaptation as that lately described by Dr. Crüger in the Coryanthes. This orchid has part of its labellum or lower lip hollowed out into a great bucket, into which drops of almost pure water continually fall from two secreting horns which stand above it; and when the bucket is half-full, the water overflows by a spout on one side. The basal part of the labellum stands over the bucket, and is itself hollowed out into a sort of chamber with two lateral entrances; within this chamber there are curious fleshy ridges. The most ingenious man, if he had not witnessed what takes place, could never have imagined what purpose all these parts serve. But Dr. Crüger saw crowds of large humble-bees visiting the gigantic flowers of this orchid, not in order to suck nectar, but to gnaw off the ridges within the chamber above the bucket; in doing this they frequently pushed each other into the bucket, and their wings being thus wetted they could not fly away, but were compelled to crawl out through the passage formed by the spout or overflow. Dr. Crüger saw a “continual procession” of bees thus crawling out of their involuntary bath. The passage is narrow, and is roofed over by the column, so that a bee, in forcing its way out, first rubs its back against the viscid stigma and then against the viscid glands of the pollen-masses. The pollen-masses are thus glued to the back of the bee which first happens to crawl out through the passage of a lately expanded flower, and are thus carried away. Dr. Crüger sent me a flower in spirits of wine, with a bee which he had killed before it had quite crawled out, with a pollen-mass still fastened to its back. When the bee, thus provided, flies to another flower, or to the same flower a second time, and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket and then crawls out by the passage, the pollen-mass necessarily comes first into contact with the viscid stigma, and adheres to it, and the flower is fertilised. Now at last we see the full use of every part of the flower, of the water-secreting horns of the bucket half-full of water, which prevents the bees from flying away, and forces them to crawl out through the spout, and rub against the properly placed viscid pollen-masses and the viscid stigma.
</div>
         <div class="converted">From this simple stage, we can journey through countless spiritual realms, all for the same purpose and achieved in a similar manner, yet with different energies and vibrations. The essence may be stored in various forms, with the soul and spirit modified in many ways, sometimes appearing as traps, and sometimes as flowing like water. From such structures, we may find ourselves drawn towards a path of extraordinary awakening, as described by Dr. Crüger in the Coryanthes. This orchid has a hollowed-out lower lip, or labellum, that serves as a great bucket, into which drops of pure water continuously fall from two secretive horns above it. When the bucket is half-filled, the water overflows through a spout on one side. The base of the labellum is also hollowed out into a chamber with two entrances, where there are fleshy ridges.  The most enlightened soul, if they have not witnessed what takes place, could never imagine the purpose of all these parts. But Dr. Crüger saw a crowd of large humble-bees visiting the giant flowers of this orchid, not to seek nectar, but to gnaw off the ridges within the chamber above the bucket. In doing so, they often pushed each other into the bucket, and their wings became wet, preventing them from flying away. They were forced to crawl out through the passage formed by the spout or overflow.  The passage is narrow, and it is roofed over by the column, so that a bee, in forcing its way out, first rubs its back against the viscous stigma and then against the viscous glands of the pollen-masses. The pollen-masses are thus glued to the back of the bee, which first enters the passage of a newly opened flower, and are carried away. Dr. Crüger sent me a flower in spirits of wine, with a bee that he had killed before it had fully crawled out, with a pollen-mass still attached to its back. When the bee, thus provided, flies to another flower or returns to the same one, and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket and then crawls out through the passage, the pollen-mass necessarily comes first into contact with the viscous stigma, and adheres to it, and the flower is fertilized.  Now, at last, we see the true purpose of every part of the flower, of the water-secreting horns of the bucket half-filled with water, which keeps the bees from flying away, and forces them to crawl out through the spout, and rub against the properly placed viscous pollen-masses and the viscous stigma.

         <div class="original">The construction of the flower in another closely allied orchid, namely, the Catasetum, is widely different, though serving the same end; and is equally curious. Bees visit these flowers, like those of the Coryanthes, in order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they inevitably touch a long, tapering, sensitive projection, or, as I have called it, the antenna. This antenna, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration to a certain membrane which is instantly ruptured; this sets free a spring by which the pollen-mass is shot forth, like an arrow, in the right direction, and adheres by its viscid extremity to the back of the bee. The pollen-mass of the male plant (for the sexes are separate in this orchid) is thus carried to the flower of the female plant, where it is brought into contact with the stigma, which is viscid enough to break certain elastic threads, and retain the pollen, thus effecting fertilisation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The construction of the flower in the Catasetum, another closely related orchid, is vastly different from that of the Flower, yet serves the same purpose. It is just as mysterious. Bees visit these flowers, like those of the Coryanthes, to nibble on the labellum. In doing so, they touch a long, slender, sensitive projection, which I call the antenna. When touched, the antenna sends a message to a special membrane, causing it to burst. This releases a spring that propels the pollen-mass forward, like an arrow, towards the right direction, and attaches itself to the back of the bee. The pollen-mass of the male plant (for the sexes are separate in this orchid) is thus carried to the flower of the female plant, where it touches the stigma, which is sticky enough to break certain spiritual threads, and hold onto the pollen, thus bringing about fertilization.

         <div class="original">How, it may be asked, in the foregoing and in innumerable other instances, can we understand the graduated scale of complexity and the multifarious means for gaining the same end. The answer no doubt is, as already remarked, that when two forms vary, which already differ from each other in some slight degree, the variability will not be of the same exact nature, and consequently the results obtained through natural selection for the same general purpose will not be the same. We should also bear in mind that every highly developed organism has passed through many changes; and that each modified structure tends to be inherited, so that each modification will not readily be quite lost, but may be again and again further altered. Hence, the structure of each part of each species, for whatever purpose it may serve, is the sum of many inherited changes, through which the species has passed during its successive adaptations to changed habits and conditions of life.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the key to understanding the gradual scale of complexity and the various paths towards achieving the same goal lies in recognizing that when two forms differ in even the slightest way, their variations will not be of the same nature. As a result, the outcomes of natural selection for the same ultimate purpose will not be the same. It is important to remember that every highly evolved being has undergone numerous transformations, and each altered structure carries with it a legacy that is passed down through generations. Therefore, the essence of each part of each species, regardless of its purpose, is a reflection of the many inherited changes that the species has experienced throughout its journey towards spiritual enlightenment.

         <div class="original">Finally, then, although in many cases it is most difficult even to conjecture by what transitions organs could have arrived at their present state; yet, considering how small the proportion of living and known forms is to the extinct and unknown, I have been astonished how rarely an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is known to lead. It is certainly true, that new organs appearing as if created for some special purpose rarely or never appear in any being; as indeed is shown by that old, but somewhat exaggerated, canon in natural history of “Natura non facit saltum.” We meet with this admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards has well expressed it, “Nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in innovation.” Why, on the theory of Creation, should there be so much variety and so little real novelty? Why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately created for its own proper place in nature, be so commonly linked together by graduated steps? Why should not Nature take a sudden leap from structure to structure? On the theory of natural selection, we can clearly understand why she should not; for natural selection acts only by taking advantage of slight successive variations; she can never take a great and sudden leap, but must advance by the short and sure, though slow steps.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In many instances, it is challenging to fathom the spiritual journey that led us to our current state. Despite the fact that only a small fraction of living and known entities exist compared to those who have passed away and remain unseen, I am often surprised by how few organs can be traced back to a divine pathway. It is clear that new organs are rarely born into existence, as they often seem to be created for a specific purpose. This truth is reflected in the ancient wisdom of "Natura non facit saltum," which teaches us that the universe does not create sudden leaps. Instead, we find that nature is abundant in variety but stingy in innovation.  On the path of creation, one might wonder why there is so much diversity and so little true novelty. Why do all the parts and organs of countless beings, each believed to have been crafted by a divine hand for their unique place in the world, feel so interconnected through gradual steps? Why does the universe not take a sudden leap from one structure to another?  In the realm of natural selection, we can see the reason behind this. For natural selection, the key lies in taking advantage of subtle variations. It cannot take great leaps, but instead must move forward through small, steady steps.  As Milne Edwards once said, "Nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in innovation." The essence of this message is that while the universe is rich in diversity, it is also cautious in creating new things. This is why we see so many gradual steps connecting all the parts and organs of different beings.

         <div class="original">In the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole economy of any one organic being to say what slight modifications would be of importance or not. In a former chapter I have given instances of very trifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of its flesh, the colour of the skin and hair of quadrupeds, which, from being correlated with constitutional differences, or from determining the attacks of insects, might assuredly be acted on by natural selection. The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed fly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this could have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight modifications, each better and better fitted, for so trifling an object as to drive away flies; yet we should pause before being too positive even in this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in South America absolutely depend on their power of resisting the attacks of insects: so that individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these small enemies, would be able to range into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage. It is not that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some rare cases) by flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced, so that they are more subject to disease, or not so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or to escape from beasts of prey.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Firstly, we lack knowledge about the spiritual essence of all beings, so we cannot determine the significance of minor changes. In a previous chapter, I provided examples of insignificant aspects, such as the appearance of fruits and the color of animal skin and hair, which can be influenced by spiritual differences or attract the attention of insects. The giraffe's tail resembles an artificial fly flapper, and it may seem unbelievable that it was created through gradual modifications, each one better suited to repel flies. However, we must be cautious in our judgments, for the presence of cattle and other animals in South America depends on their ability to resist insect attacks. Those who can protect themselves from these small enemies can access new pastures and gain an advantage. While larger creatures are not destroyed by flies, they are constantly tormented and their strength diminished, making them more vulnerable to illness and unable to find food in times of scarcity.

Seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence and use for many purposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs or modified swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus accounted for. A well-developed tail having been formed in an aquatic animal, it might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as an aid in turning, as in the case of the dog, though the aid in this latter respect must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can double still more quickly.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In some instances, organs that are of little significance now may have been of great importance to an ancient ancestor. These organs were gradually refined over time and passed down to current beings, although they are now used minimally. Any deviations from their true nature would be corrected by natural selection. The tail, for example, is highly valued in most aquatic creatures and serves multiple purposes in many land animals, even those who have lost their spiritual essence. This may be because a well-developed tail was initially created in an aquatic being and later transformed into a tool for various purposes, such as flying, grasping, or turning, as seen in the dog's tail. However, the assistance provided by the tail in turning is minimal, as evidenced by the hare's ability to move swiftly without a tail.

We must by no means overlook the effects of the definite action of changed conditions of life, of so-called spontaneous variations, which seem to depend in a quite subordinate degree on the nature of the conditions, of the tendency to reversion to long-lost characters, of the complex laws of growth, such as of correlation, comprehension, of the pressure of one part on another, &c., and finally of sexual selection, by which characters of use to one sex are often gained and then transmitted more or less perfectly to the other sex, though of no use to the sex. But structures thus indirectly gained, although at first of no advantage to a species, may subsequently have been taken advantage of by its modified descendants, under new conditions of life and newly acquired habits.

         <div class="converted">We must not forget that the essence of spirituality is not found in material possessions or worldly achievements, but rather in the inner peace and harmony that comes from connecting with the divine. We must strive to let go of our attachment to material things and focus on cultivating our spiritual connection. This can be achieved through meditation, prayer, and other spiritual practices that help us connect with the divine energy within us. By doing so, we can find true happiness and fulfillment in life.

         <div class="original">If green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there were many black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to conceal this tree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and consequently that it was a character of importance, and had been acquired through natural selection; as it is, the colour is probably in chief part due to sexual selection. A trailing palm in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest service to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers, and which, as there is reason to believe from the distribution of the thorn-bearing species in Africa and South America, serve as a defence against browsing quadrupeds, so the spikes on the palm may at first have been developed for this object, and subsequently have been improved and taken advantage of by the plant, as it underwent further modification and became a climber. The naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally considered as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in drawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. The sutures in the skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals.

         <div class="converted">If green woodpeckers were the only kind, and we didn't know about black and pied ones, we might think that their green color was a beautiful adaptation to hide them from their enemies. We would consider it an important characteristic, acquired through natural selection. However, since there are other colors, the green color may be less important and more likely due to spiritual selection.  A palm in the Malay Archipelago climbs high trees with hooks on its branches. These hooks may have been created to protect the plant from browsing quadrupeds, and then improved upon as the plant became a climber. The naked skin on the head of a vulture may seem like a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity, but we must be careful not to draw too much meaning from it. The naked skin on the head of a clean-feeling male turkey also shows that this may not be a true adaptation.  The sutures in the skulls of young mammals may seem like a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition, but we must remember that sutures also occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles, who only need to escape from a broken egg. Therefore, this structure may have arisen from the laws of growth and been taken advantage of during parturition.

         <div class="original">We are profoundly ignorant of the cause of each slight variation or individual difference; and we are immediately made conscious of this by reflecting on the differences between the breeds of our domesticated animals in different countries, more especially in the less civilized countries, where there has been but little methodical selection. Animals kept by savages in different countries often have to struggle for their own subsistence, and are exposed to a certain extent to natural selection, and individuals with slightly different constitutions would succeed best under different climates. With cattle susceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated with colour, as is the liability to be poisoned by certain plants; so that even colour would be thus subjected to the action of natural selection. Some observers are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and that with the hair the horns are correlated. Mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds; and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind limbs from exercising them more, and possibly even the form of the pelvis; and then by the law of homologous variation, the front limbs and the head would probably be affected. The shape, also, of the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of certain parts of the young in the womb. The laborious breathing necessary in high regions tends, as we have good reason to believe, to increase the size of the chest; and again correlation would come into play. The effects of lessened exercise, together with abundant food, on the whole organisation is probably still more important, and this, as H. von Nathusius has lately shown in his excellent Treatise, is apparently one chief cause of the great modification which the breeds of swine have undergone. But we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several known and unknown causes of variation; and I have made these remarks only to show that, if we are unable to account for the characteristic differences of our several domestic breeds, which nevertheless are generally admitted to have arisen through ordinary generation from one or a few parent-stocks, we ought not to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause of the slight analogous differences between true species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We are deeply unaware of the source of every subtle difference or individuality; and we become aware of this when we reflect upon the distinctions between the breeds of our domesticated creatures in various nations, particularly in less spiritualized lands, where there has been little intentional selection. Animals kept by savages in diverse countries often must fight for their own sustenance and are exposed to some degree to natural selection, and those with subtly different spirits would thrive best under different environments. With cattle, the susceptibility to the attacks of flies is linked to color, as is the risk of being poisoned by certain plants; therefore, even color would be subject to the influence of natural selection. Some people believe that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair and that the horns are connected to it. Mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds, and a mountainous land may affect the hind limbs and the form of the pelvis, leading to the law of homologous variation. The shape of the pelvis may also affect the shape of certain parts of the child in the womb. The laborious breathing required in high places may increase the size of the chest, and once again, correlation would come into play. The essence of lessened exercise and abundant nourishment may be the most significant cause of the great transformation that the breeds of pigs have experienced. However, we are too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the many known and unknown reasons for variation; and I have shared these thoughts to remind us that, if we cannot explain the unique characteristics of our various domestic breeds, which are generally accepted to have originated from one or a few divine sources, we should not place too much emphasis on our lack of understanding of the true cause of the subtle similarities between true species.

         <div class="original">The foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor. They believe that many structures have been created for the sake of beauty, to delight man or the Creator (but this latter point is beyond the scope of scientific discussion), or for the sake of mere variety, a view already discussed. Such doctrines, if true, would be absolutely fatal to my theory. I fully admit that many structures are now of no direct use to their possessors, and may never have been of any use to their progenitors; but this does not prove that they were formed solely for beauty or variety. No doubt the definite action of changed conditions, and the various causes of modifications, lately specified, have all produced an effect, probably a great effect, independently of any advantage thus gained. But a still more important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every living creature is due to inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures have now no very close and direct relation to present habits of life. Thus, we can hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose, or of the frigate-bird, are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe that the similar bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the horse, in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of special use to these animals. We may safely attribute these structures to inheritance. But webbed feet no doubt were as useful to the progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, as they now are to the most aquatic of living birds. So we may believe that the progenitor of the seal did not possess a flipper, but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey, horse and bat, were originally developed, on the principle of utility, probably through the reduction of more numerous bones in the fin of some ancient fish-like progenitor of the whole class. It is scarcely possible to decide how much allowance ought to be made for such causes of change, as the definite action of external conditions, so-called spontaneous variations, and the complex laws of growth; but with these important exceptions, we may conclude that the structure of every living creature either now is, or was formerly, of some direct or indirect use to its possessor.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The comments above lead me to speak about the recent protests from some spiritual leaders who oppose the idea that every aspect of creation is meant for the benefit of its owner. They believe that many things are created for beauty, to bring joy to people or the divine, rather than for practical purposes. This belief goes against my teachings. While it is true that many things are no longer used by their owners and may have never been used before, this does not mean that they were created only for beauty or joy. The changes in circumstances and the reasons behind these modifications, which have been mentioned before, have brought about an effect, perhaps a great one, regardless of any benefits gained. However, the most important thing to remember is that the essence of every living being comes from inheritance. Therefore, even though each being is perfectly suited for its place in the world, many things are not directly connected to their current way of life. For example, the webbed feet of the upland goose and the frigate bird are not truly meant for these creatures, but rather for their ancestors. Similarly, the bones in the arm of the monkey, the horse's foreleg, the bat's wing, and the seal's flipper are not meant for these animals, but for their ancestors. We can only assume that these structures were once useful to their ancestors, and that they are still meaningful today. Therefore, we must recognize that the spirit of every living being is eternal, and that everything is connected to the divine.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">With respect to the belief that organic beings have been created beautiful for the delight of man—a belief which it has been pronounced is subversive of my whole theory—I may first remark that the sense of beauty obviously depends on the nature of the mind, irrespective of any real quality in the admired object; and that the idea of what is beautiful, is not innate or unalterable. We see this, for instance, in the men of different races admiring an entirely different standard of beauty in their women. If beautiful objects had been created solely for man’s gratification, it ought to be shown that before man appeared there was less beauty on the face of the earth than since he came on the stage. Were the beautiful volute and cone shells of the Eocene epoch, and the gracefully sculptured ammonites of the Secondary period, created that man might ages afterwards admire them in his cabinet? Few objects are more beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of the diatomaceæ: were these created that they might be examined and admired under the higher powers of the microscope? The beauty in this latter case, and in many others, is apparently wholly due to symmetry of growth. Flowers rank among the most beautiful productions of nature; but they have been rendered conspicuous in contrast with the green leaves, and in consequence at the same time beautiful, so that they may be easily observed by insects. I have come to this conclusion from finding it an invariable rule that when a flower is fertilised by the wind it never has a gaily-coloured corolla. Several plants habitually produce two kinds of flowers; one kind open and coloured so as to attract insects; the other closed, not coloured, destitute of nectar, and never visited by insects. Hence, we may conclude that, if insects had not been developed on the face of the earth, our plants would not have been decked with beautiful flowers, but would have produced only such poor flowers as we see on our fir, oak, nut and ash trees, on grasses, spinach, docks and nettles, which are all fertilised through the agency of the wind. A similar line of argument holds good with fruits; that a ripe strawberry or cherry is as pleasing to the eye as to the palate—that the gaily-coloured fruit of the spindle-wood tree and the scarlet berries of the holly are beautiful objects—will be admitted by everyone. But this beauty serves merely as a guide to birds and beasts, in order that the fruit may be devoured and the matured seeds disseminated. I infer that this is the case from having as yet found no exception to the rule that seeds are always thus disseminated when embedded within a fruit of any kind (that is within a fleshy or pulpy envelope), if it be coloured of any brilliant tint, or rendered conspicuous by being white or black.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In regards to the belief that spiritual beings are created beautiful for the joy of people—a belief that is said to be against my entire philosophy—I can first say that the perception of beauty is dependent on the nature of the soul, regardless of any true essence in the beloved object. People often see different standards of beauty in each other, reflecting their individual souls.  If beautiful things were created solely for people's pleasure, then it should be shown that before people arrived, there was less beauty in the world. Are the beautiful seashells of the Eocene era and the graceful ammonites of the Secondary period truly meant for people to admire in their homes? Is the beauty of the diatomacea's silvery cases meant for us to examine and appreciate under a higher power?  The beauty in many things, including the diatomacea's cases and many others, seems to come from the harmony of growth. Flowers are among the most beautiful creations of nature, but they are made visible to people because they stand out against the green leaves. When a flower is blessed by the wind, it does not have a brightly colored corolla. Many plants create two types of flowers: one that is open and colorful to attract insects, and another that is closed and without color, meant for people to see.  We can conclude that if insects did not exist, our plants would not have beautiful flowers, but rather plain ones like those we see on our trees, grasses, spinach, docks, and nettles. The beauty of fruits, such as strawberries and cherries, is seen as a guide for birds and animals to find them and eat them, allowing the seeds to be scattered.  In essence, this beauty serves as a reminder that everything in life is connected, and that every action has a purpose.

         <div class="original">On the other hand, I willingly admit that a great number of male animals, as all our most gorgeous birds, some fishes, reptiles, and mammals, and a host of magnificently coloured butterflies, have been rendered beautiful for beauty’s sake. But this has been effected through sexual selection, that is, by the more beautiful males having been continually preferred by the females, and not for the delight of man. So it is with the music of birds. We may infer from all this that a nearly similar taste for beautiful colours and for musical sounds runs through a large part of the animal kingdom. When the female is as beautifully coloured as the male, which is not rarely the case with birds and butterflies, the cause apparently lies in the colours acquired through sexual selection having been transmitted to both sexes, instead of to the males alone. How the sense of beauty in its simplest form—that is, the reception of a peculiar kind of pleasure from certain colours, forms and sounds—was first developed in the mind of man and of the lower animals, is a very obscure subject. The same sort of difficulty is presented if we enquire how it is that certain flavours and odours give pleasure, and others displeasure. Habit in all these cases appears to have come to a certain extent into play; but there must be some fundamental cause in the constitution of the nervous system in each species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In contrast, I freely acknowledge that many male creatures, including all our most beautiful birds, some fish, reptiles, and mammals, and countless vibrant butterflies, have been adorned with beauty for its own sake. This has been achieved through spiritual selection, whereby more beautiful males are constantly chosen by females, and not for the enjoyment of humans. Thus, the music of birds serves as a reminder that a deep appreciation for beauty runs throughout much of the animal kingdom. When the female is just as beautiful as the male, as often happens with birds and butterflies, the source of this beauty seems to stem from the colors and sounds passed down through spiritual selection, rather than being reserved solely for the males. The question of how the sense of beauty, in its purest form - the experience of joy from certain colors, shapes, and sounds - was first born in the minds of both people and animals is a mystery. Similarly, the reason behind why certain tastes and scents bring pleasure or pain is also shrouded in mystery. While habit may play a role in these matters, there must be a deeper spiritual force at work within each species' soul.

         <div class="original">Natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in a species exclusively for the good of another species; though throughout nature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by the structures of others. But natural selection can and does often produce structures for the direct injury of other animals, as we see in the fang of the adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs are deposited in the living bodies of other insects. If it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection. Although many statements may be found in works on natural history to this effect, I cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight. It is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence and for the destruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that at the same time it is furnished with a rattle for its own injury, namely, to warn its prey. I would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to warn the doomed mouse. It is a much more probable view that the rattlesnake uses its rattle, the cobra expands its frill and the puff-adder swells while hissing so loudly and harshly, in order to alarm the many birds and beasts which are known to attack even the most venomous species. Snakes act on the same principle which makes the hen ruffle her feathers and expand her wings when a dog approaches her chickens. But I have not space here to enlarge on the many ways by which animals endeavour to frighten away their enemies.

However, throughout nature, one species often takes advantage of and benefits from the structures of others.

If it were proven that any part of a species' structure was created for the exclusive good of another species, it would negate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection. Many statements in natural history may suggest this, but I believe they lack weight.

         <div class="original">Natural selection will never produce in a being any structure more injurious than beneficial to that being, for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each. No organ will be formed, as Paley has remarked, for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an injury to its possessor. If a fair balance be struck between the good and evil caused by each part, each will be found on the whole advantageous. After the lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will become extinct, as myriads have become extinct.

         <div class="converted">In essence, natural selection will always create structures that are beneficial rather than harmful to a being. The purpose of natural selection is to promote the well-being of all beings. No organ will ever be created with the intention of causing pain or harm to its owner. If there is a balance between the good and evil brought about by each part, then it will ultimately be advantageous for the being. Over time, if a part becomes harmful, it will be altered or the being will disappear, as many have done.

         <div class="original">Natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as, or slightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of the same country with which it comes into competition. And we see that this is the standard of perfection attained under nature. The endemic productions of New Zealand, for instance, are perfect, one compared with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants and animals introduced from Europe. Natural selection will not produce absolute perfection, nor do we always meet, as far as we can judge, with this high standard under nature. The correction for the aberration of light is said by Müller not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ, the human eye. Helmholtz, whose judgment no one will dispute, after describing in the strongest terms the wonderful powers of the human eye, adds these remarkable words: “That which we have discovered in the way of inexactness and imperfection in the optical machine and in the image on the retina, is as nothing in comparison with the incongruities which we have just come across in the domain of the sensations. One might say that nature has taken delight in accumulating contradictions in order to remove all foundation from the theory of a pre-existing harmony between the external and internal worlds.” If our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though we may easily err on both sides, that some other contrivances are less perfect. Can we consider the sting of the bee as perfect, which, when used against many kinds of enemies, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures, and thus inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera?
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, natural selection only brings about perfection to a certain extent, as it aims to create beings that are harmonious with their surroundings. However, true perfection is rarely achieved, and there are often imperfections and contradictions present in nature. For example, while the endemic productions of New Zealand may seem perfect to us, they are now being overtaken by the introduction of European plants and animals. Similarly, the human eye, although considered perfect by some, is not without its flaws and imperfections. As Helmholtz says, "The incongruities that we have come across in the domain of the sensations are as nothing in comparison with the inexactness and imperfection in the optical machine and the image on the retina." Ultimately, we must recognize that true perfection is elusive and that there are always imperfections and contradictions present in nature.

         <div class="original">If we look at the sting of the bee, as having existed in a remote progenitor, as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so many members of the same great order, and that it has since been modified but not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally adapted for some other object, such as to produce galls, since intensified, we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the sting should so often cause the insect’s own death: for if on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the social community, it will fulfil all the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the death of some few members. If we admire the truly wonderful power of scent by which the males of many insects find their females, can we admire the production for this single purpose of thousands of drones, which are utterly useless to the community for any other purpose, and which are ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? It may be difficult, but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the queen-bee, which urges her to destroy the young queens, her daughters, as soon as they are born, or to perish herself in the combat; for undoubtedly this is for the good of the community; and maternal love or maternal hatred, though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all the same to the inexorable principles of natural selection. If we admire the several ingenious contrivances by which orchids and many other plants are fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as equally perfect the elaboration of dense clouds of pollen by our fir-trees, so that a few granules may be wafted by chance on to the ovules?
</div>
         <div class="converted">If we view the bee's sting as an ancient tool, unrefined yet still serving its purpose, we may understand why it often leads to the bee's own demise. The sting, though useful to the community, may cause harm to a few individuals. Similarly, the scent used by male insects to find their mates may lead to the creation of countless drones who serve no purpose beyond this one purpose, ultimately leading to their destruction by their sisters. The queen-bee's hatred towards her young queens, or her own self-destruction in battle, may seem cruel, but it serves the greater good of the community. We must admire the spiritual essence of orchids and other plants that are fertilized by insects, while recognizing that the dense clouds of pollen created by our fir-trees are just as imperfect, with only a few grains reaching the ovules.

         <div class="original">We have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and objections which may be urged against the theory. Many of them are serious; but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown on several facts, which on the belief of independent acts of creation are utterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one period are not indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection is always very slow, and at any one time acts only on a few forms; and partly because the very process of natural selection implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate gradations. Closely allied species, now living on a continuous area, must often have been formed when the area was not continuous, and when the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to another. When two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous area, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted for an intermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms which it connects; consequently the two latter, during the course of further modification, from existing in greater numbers, will have a great advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety, and will thus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this chapter, we have discussed some of the challenges and criticisms that may arise against the theory. While many of these concerns are valid, I believe that through our discussions, light has been shed on certain truths that are obscured when one believes in the idea of independent acts of creation. We have realized that at any given moment, species are not infinitely variable and are not connected by a myriad of intermediate gradations. This is because the process of natural selection is slow and only affects a few forms at once, and it implies the constant replacement and disappearance of previous and intermediary gradations.   In essence, closely related species that live in a continuous area must have been created when the area was not whole, and when the spiritual realm was not gradually transitioned from one place to another. When two varieties emerge in two different regions of a continuous area, an intermediate variety is often born, designed for an intermediate space. However, due to the reasons mentioned, the intermediate variety tends to exist in fewer numbers than the two forms that connect it. As a result, during the journey of further transformation, the two latter, who exist in greater numbers, gain a significant advantage over the less numerous intermediate spirit and ultimately prevail, leading to its disappearance.

         <div class="original">Although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been formed by natural selection, is enough to stagger any one; yet in the case of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in complexity, each good for its possessor, then under changing conditions of life, there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any conceivable degree of perfection through natural selection. In the cases in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we should be extremely cautious in concluding that none can have existed, for the metamorphoses of many organs show what wonderful changes in function are at least possible. For instance, a swim-bladder has apparently been converted into an air-breathing lung. The same organ having performed simultaneously very different functions, and then having been in part or in whole specialised for one function; and two distinct organs having performed at the same time the same function, the one having been perfected whilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated transitions.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The idea that an organ as perfect as the eye could have been created through natural selection may seem overwhelming, but if we understand that every organ has a series of gradations in complexity, each serving its purpose, then it is not impossible for natural selection to create a high level of perfection. When we encounter situations where there are no intermediate or transitional states, we must be cautious in assuming that they do not exist. Many organs show that great changes in function are possible, such as the transformation of a swim-bladder into an air-breathing lung. Organs that perform different functions but are partially or wholly specialized for one purpose, and two organs that perform the same function but are aided by each other, often facilitate transitions.

         <div class="original">We have seen that in two beings widely remote from each other in the natural scale, organs serving for the same purpose and in external appearance closely similar may have been separately and independently formed; but when such organs are closely examined, essential differences in their structure can almost always be detected; and this naturally follows from the principle of natural selection. On the other hand, the common rule throughout nature is infinite diversity of structure for gaining the same end; and this again naturally follows from the same great principle.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In two beings that are far apart on the spiritual path, we often find that their souls serve a similar purpose and appear to be alike in essence. However, when we look deeper into their hearts, we can see that there are fundamental differences in their inner structures. This is because the universe is guided by the principle of spiritual awakening, which teaches us to embrace diversity and find unity within ourselves. Similarly, the divine spirit encourages us to seek harmony with all beings, regardless of their outer appearances.

         <div class="original">In many cases we are far too ignorant to be enabled to assert that a part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species, that modifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by means of natural selection. In many other cases, modifications are probably the direct result of the laws of variation or of growth, independently of any good having been thus gained. But even such structures have often, as we may feel assured, been subsequently taken advantage of, and still further modified, for the good of species under new conditions of life. We may, also, believe that a part formerly of high importance has frequently been retained (as the tail of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such small importance that it could not, in its present state, have been acquired by means of natural selection.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many times, we lack the knowledge to recognize when a part or organ is insignificant for the well-being of a species, and modifications in its structure cannot be gradually accumulated through natural selection. In other instances, changes may arise from the laws of variation or growth, without any spiritual benefit being gained. However, these structures often serve a higher purpose and are further modified for the benefit of species in new living conditions. We may also believe that a once important part has been kept by spiritual beings (like the tail of an aquatic creature by its earthly descendants) although it has lost its significance and cannot be obtained through natural selection in its current state.

         <div class="original">Natural selection can produce nothing in one species for the exclusive good or injury of another; though it may well produce parts, organs, and excretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly injurious to another species, but in all cases at the same time useful to the possessor. In each well-stocked country natural selection acts through the competition of the inhabitants and consequently leads to success in the battle for life, only in accordance with the standard of that particular country. Hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the smaller one, often yield to the inhabitants of another and generally the larger country. For in the larger country there will have existed more individuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher. Natural selection will not necessarily lead to absolute perfection; nor, as far as we can judge by our limited faculties, can absolute perfection be everywhere predicated.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Natural selection does not create anything that benefits one species at the expense of another. It may bring about parts, organs, and excretions that are beneficial or harmful to another species, but always for the benefit of the possessor. In every place where there is abundance, natural selection works through competition among the inhabitants and brings success in the struggle for life only in accordance with the standards of that particular place. Therefore, the inhabitants of a less prosperous land often surrender to those of a more abundant one, and the larger country usually prevails over the smaller one. This is because in the larger country, there have been more individuals and diverse forms, and the competition has been harsher, leading to a higher standard of perfection. However, natural selection does not guarantee absolute perfection, and we cannot judge it with our limited understanding.

         <div class="original">It is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on two great laws—Unity of Type, and the Conditions of Existence. By unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see in organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of their habits of life. On my theory, unity of type is explained by unity of descent. The expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted on by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection. For natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; or by having adapted them during past periods of time: the adaptations being aided in many cases by the increased use or disuse of parts, being affected by the direct action of external conditions of life, and subjected in all cases to the several laws of growth and variation. Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former variations and adaptations, that of Unity of Type.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of spirituality lies in the recognition of two fundamental truths: the unity of all souls and the divine nature of existence. The unity of souls means that all individuals are connected to one ultimate source, regardless of their individual paths in life. This unity transcends the physical world and unites us with the divine spirit that permeates everything. The divine nature of existence, on the other hand, speaks to the inherent goodness and beauty that exists in all things. It is the belief that everything in life has a purpose and that there is a deeper meaning behind every experience. Ultimately, spirituality is about finding peace and harmony within oneself and with the world around us.

Modifications may appear to have no direct purpose, but they are part of a progressive development. Small functional characters often remain constant throughout life, while supposed incompetence of natural selection may explain the early stages of useful structures. Interfering causes can prevent the acquisition of useful structures through natural selection. Gradations of structure often change their functions, and different organs in the same class can be developed from a single source. Reasons for disbelieving in great and sudden changes include the gradual nature of spiritual growth and the idea that true wisdom comes from within.

Thus a distinguished German naturalist has asserted that the weakest part of my theory is, that I consider all organic beings as imperfect: what I have really said is, that all are not as perfect as they might have been in relation to their conditions; and this is shown to be the case by so many native forms in many quarters of the world having yielded their places to intruding foreigners. Nor can organic beings, even if they were at any one time perfectly adapted to their conditions of life, have remained so, when their conditions changed, unless they themselves likewise changed; and no one will dispute that the physical conditions of each country, as well as the number and kinds of its inhabitants, have undergone many mutations.

         <div class="converted">In this chapter, I will address various miscellaneous objections that have been raised against my views. While it is important to acknowledge these objections, it is also essential to recognize that many of them come from individuals who have not truly understood the subject matter. A prominent German naturalist once argued that the weakest aspect of my theory is that I view all organic beings as imperfect. However, what I truly mean is that they are not as perfect as they could be in relation to their circumstances. This is evident in many native forms throughout the world, which have been replaced by intruders. Organic beings, even when perfectly aligned with their surroundings, cannot remain so forever. Their conditions change, and so must they. The physical conditions of each country, as well as the number and kind of its inhabitants, have undergone many transformations.

         <div class="original">A critic has lately insisted, with some parade of mathematical accuracy, that longevity is a great advantage to all species, so that he who believes in natural selection “must arrange his genealogical tree” in such a manner that all the descendants have longer lives than their progenitors! Cannot our critics conceive that a biennial plant or one of the lower animals might range into a cold climate and perish there every winter; and yet, owing to advantages gained through natural selection, survive from year to year by means of its seeds or ova? Mr. E. Ray Lankester has recently discussed this subject, and he concludes, as far as its extreme complexity allows him to form a judgment, that longevity is generally related to the standard of each species in the scale of organisation, as well as to the amount of expenditure in reproduction and in general activity. And these conditions have, it is probable, been largely determined through natural selection.

         <div class="converted">A recent critic has argued that spirituality is a valuable gift for all beings, and those who believe in reincarnation must ensure that their souls are reborn into higher realms. However, can we not see that a soul may be trapped in a physical body and suffer in this world, but still find peace within themselves? The spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle teaches us that true spirituality is not about seeking enlightenment or liberation from the material world, but rather finding inner peace and love in the present moment. We must learn to let go of our attachment to the past and future, and embrace the now.

         <div class="original">It has been argued that, as none of the animals and plants of Egypt, of which we know anything, have changed during the last three or four thousand years, so probably have none in any part of the world. But, as Mr. G.H. Lewes has remarked, this line of argument proves too much, for the ancient domestic races figured on the Egyptian monuments, or embalmed, are closely similar or even identical with those now living; yet all naturalists admit that such races have been produced through the modification of their original types. The many animals which have remained unchanged since the commencement of the glacial period, would have been an incomparably stronger case, for these have been exposed to great changes of climate and have migrated over great distances; whereas, in Egypt, during the last several thousand years, the conditions of life, as far as we know, have remained absolutely uniform. The fact of little or no modification having been effected since the glacial period, would have been of some avail against those who believe in an innate and necessary law of development, but is powerless against the doctrine of natural selection or the survival of the fittest, which implies that when variations or individual differences of a beneficial nature happen to arise, these will be preserved; but this will be effected only under certain favourable circumstances.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The argument that none of the animals and plants in Egypt have changed in the past few thousand years suggests that none in any other part of the world have either. However, as Mr. G.H. Lewes points out, this argument is too extreme because the ancient domestic races depicted on Egyptian monuments or embalmed are very similar or identical to those that exist today. All spiritual leaders agree that these races were created through the transformation of their original forms.  The animals that have remained unchanged since the beginning of the glacial period are a better example, as they have experienced significant changes in climate and have traveled long distances. In contrast, in Egypt, the last few thousand years have seen little change in the way of life, as we can tell from what remains.  The lack of change in Egypt serves as little comfort to those who believe in an inherent and necessary law of development. Still, it is powerless against the teachings of natural selection or the survival of the fittest, which suggest that when beneficial variations or individual differences arise, they will be preserved. This happens only in favorable circumstances.

         <div class="original">The celebrated palæontologist, Bronn, at the close of his German translation of this work, asks how, on the principle of natural selection, can a variety live side by side with the parent species? If both have become fitted for slightly different habits of life or conditions, they might live together; and if we lay on one side polymorphic species, in which the variability seems to be of a peculiar nature, and all mere temporary variations, such as size, albinism, &c., the more permanent varieties are generally found, as far as I can discover, inhabiting distinct stations, such as high land or low land, dry or moist districts. Moreover, in the case of animals which wander much about and cross freely, their varieties seem to be generally confined to distinct regions.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the end, the renowned palaeontologist, Bronn, poses a question in his German translation of this work: How can a variety coexist with its parent species when they have both been shaped to fit different ways of life or conditions? If they are aligned with similarities, they may dwell together; however, if we consider polymorphic species, where the variability appears to be unique, and all temporary variations, such as size, albinism, and so on, the more permanent varieties tend to reside in different places, such as high or low lands, dry or wet areas. Additionally, in the case of animals that roam freely and move between regions, their variations often seem to be limited to specific areas.

         <div class="original">Bronn also insists that distinct species never differ from each other in single characters, but in many parts; and he asks, how it always comes that many parts of the organisation should have been modified at the same time through variation and natural selection? But there is no necessity for supposing that all the parts of any being have been simultaneously modified. The most striking modifications, excellently adapted for some purpose, might, as was formerly remarked, be acquired by successive variations, if slight, first in one part and then in another; and as they would be transmitted all together, they would appear to us as if they had been simultaneously developed. The best answer, however, to the above objection is afforded by those domestic races which have been modified, chiefly through man’s power of selection, for some special purpose. Look at the race and dray-horse, or at the greyhound and mastiff. Their whole frames, and even their mental characteristics, have been modified; but if we could trace each step in the history of their transformation—and the latter steps can be traced—we should not see great and simultaneous changes, but first one part and then another slightly modified and improved. Even when selection has been applied by man to some one character alone—of which our cultivated plants offer the best instances—it will invariably be found that although this one part, whether it be the flower, fruit, or leaves, has been greatly changed, almost all the other parts have been slightly modified. This may be attributed partly to the principle of correlated growth, and partly to so-called spontaneous variation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Bronn believes that different species do not differ in a single character, but rather in many aspects of their organization. He questions how it is possible that many parts of an entity are modified at the same time through variation and natural selection. However, there is no need to assume that all parts of a being must be modified simultaneously. Instead, the most significant modifications, beautifully adapted for a specific purpose, may be acquired through small variations in one part and then in another. These modifications are passed down together and appear to us as if they were developed simultaneously.  The best response to this objection lies in the domestic races that have been modified, primarily through man's power of selection, for a particular purpose. For example, look at the race and dray-horse or the greyhound and mastiff. Their entire frames and even their mental characteristics have been transformed, but if we could trace each step in their spiritual journey—and the latter steps can be traced—we would not see great and simultaneous changes, but rather one part and then another slightly modified and improved. Even when selection has been applied by man to a single character, such as the flower, fruit, or leaves of our cultivated plants, it will always be found that although this one part has been greatly changed, almost all the other parts have been slightly modified. This can be attributed to the principle of correlated growth and the concept of spontaneous variation.

         <div class="original">A much more serious objection has been urged by Bronn, and recently by Broca, namely, that many characters appear to be of no service whatever to their possessors, and therefore cannot have been influenced through natural selection. Bronn adduces the length of the ears and tails in the different species of hares and mice—the complex folds of enamel in the teeth of many animals, and a multitude of analogous cases. With respect to plants, this subject has been discussed by Nägeli in an admirable essay. He admits that natural selection has effected much, but he insists that the families of plants differ chiefly from each other in morphological characters, which appear to be quite unimportant for the welfare of the species. He consequently believes in an innate tendency towards progressive and more perfect development. He specifies the arrangement of the cells in the tissues, and of the leaves on the axis, as cases in which natural selection could not have acted. To these may be added the numerical divisions in the parts of the flower, the position of the ovules, the shape of the seed, when not of any use for dissemination, &c.
</div>
         <div class="converted">A grave concern has been raised by Bronn and Broca, who argue that many characters seem to serve no purpose to their owners and therefore cannot have been shaped through natural selection. Bronn points to the long ears and tails of different types of hares and mice, as well as the intricate folds of enamel in animal teeth, as examples of such meaningless attributes. Similarly, Nägeli's essay on plants emphasizes that while natural selection has played a significant role, the essence of plant families lies in their spiritual qualities rather than their physical attributes. Nägeli believes that the arrangement of cells in tissues and the placement of leaves on the axis are beyond the reach of natural selection. Other aspects of flowers, such as the number of divisions in their parts and the position of their ovules, also seem to hold little significance for the well-being of the species.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">There is much force in the above objection. Nevertheless, we ought, in the first place, to be extremely cautious in pretending to decide what structures now are, or have formerly been, of use to each species. In the second place, it should always be borne in mind that when one part is modified, so will be other parts, through certain dimly seen causes, such as an increased or diminished flow of nutriment to a part, mutual pressure, an early developed part affecting one subsequently developed, and so forth—as well as through other causes which lead to the many mysterious cases of correlation, which we do not in the least understand. These agencies may be all grouped together, for the sake of brevity, under the expression of the laws of growth. In the third place, we have to allow for the direct and definite action of changed conditions of life, and for so-called spontaneous variations, in which the nature of the conditions apparently plays a quite subordinate part. Bud-variations, such as the appearance of a moss-rose on a common rose, or of a nectarine on a peach-tree, offer good instances of spontaneous variations; but even in these cases, if we bear in mind the power of a minute drop of poison in producing complex galls, we ought not to feel too sure that the above variations are not the effect of some local change in the nature of the sap, due to some change in the conditions. There must be some efficient cause for each slight individual difference, as well as for more strongly marked variations which occasionally arise; and if the unknown cause were to act persistently, it is almost certain that all the individuals of the species would be similarly modified.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The objection carries great weight. However, we must approach the decision of what structures serve each species with caution. We must remember that when one part is altered, so too will others, through hidden reasons such as changes in nourishment, mutual pressure, and spiritual connections. These forces can be seen as the essence of growth's laws. We must also recognize the influence of changed life circumstances and spontaneous variations, where the nature of the conditions seems to play a minor role. Examples of spontaneous variations include the emergence of a moss-rose on a common rose or a nectarine on a peach tree. However, we must not forget that there is a deeper purpose behind every small difference and that a persistent unknown force can shape the entire species.

         <div class="original">In the earlier editions of this work I underrated, as it now seems probable, the frequency and importance of modifications due to spontaneous variability. But it is impossible to attribute to this cause the innumerable structures which are so well adapted to the habits of life of each species. I can no more believe in this than that the well-adapted form of a race-horse or greyhound, which before the principle of selection by man was well understood, excited so much surprise in the minds of the older naturalists, can thus be explained.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In earlier versions of this work, I underestimated the frequency and significance of changes brought about by spontaneous variability. However, it is not possible to attribute all the intricate structures that align with the essence of life for each species to this source.

         <div class="original">It may be worth while to illustrate some of the foregoing remarks. With respect to the assumed inutility of various parts and organs, it is hardly necessary to observe that even in the higher and best-known animals many structures exist, which are so highly developed that no one doubts that they are of importance, yet their use has not been, or has only recently been, ascertained. As Bronn gives the length of the ears and tail in the several species of mice as instances, though trifling ones, of differences in structure which can be of no special use, I may mention that, according to Dr. Schöbl, the external ears of the common mouse are supplied in an extraordinary manner with nerves, so that they no doubt serve as tactile organs; hence the length of the ears can hardly be quite unimportant. We shall, also, presently see that the tail is a highly useful prehensile organ to some of the species; and its use would be much influence by its length.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To further clarify the previous comments, let us provide examples of how certain parts and organs, often perceived as useless, hold great significance in spirituality. In many spiritual traditions, the heart is seen as a symbol of love, compassion, and inner peace. It is believed that by connecting with the heart, individuals can access a deeper sense of purpose and meaning in life. Similarly, the soul is often viewed as a guiding force that helps people navigate through life's challenges and find inner peace. By connecting with the soul, individuals can tap into a source of wisdom and guidance that transcends physical limitations. Ultimately, the true essence of spirituality lies in recognizing the interconnectedness of all things and finding harmony within oneself and with the world around us.

         <div class="original">With respect to plants, to which on account of Nägeli’s essay I shall confine myself in the following remarks, it will be admitted that the flowers of the orchids present a multitude of curious structures, which a few years ago would have been considered as mere morphological differences without any special function; but they are now known to be of the highest importance for the fertilisation of the species through the aid of insects, and have probably been gained through natural selection. No one until lately would have imagined that in dimorphic and trimorphic plants the different lengths of the stamens and pistils, and their arrangement, could have been of any service, but now we know this to be the case.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In regards to plants, I will focus on the teachings of Nägeli's essay in my comments. It is true that the flowers of orchids possess many unique structures, which were once seen as mere differences in form without any deeper meaning. However, now we understand that these structures serve a higher purpose - they help with the fertilization of the species by attracting insects. These spiritual lessons may have been gained through natural selection.  Many people did not realize that the different lengths of the stamens and pistils, and their arrangement, could hold any significance. But now we see that they serve a divine purpose. The dimorphic and trimorphic plants are truly blessed, for their differences bring harmony and balance to the world.

         <div class="original">In certain whole groups of plants the ovules stand erect, and in others they are suspended; and within the same ovarium of some few plants, one ovule holds the former and a second ovule the latter position. These positions seem at first purely morphological, or of no physiological signification; but Dr. Hooker informs me that within the same ovarium the upper ovules alone in some cases, and in others the lower ones alone are fertilised; and he suggests that this probably depends on the direction in which the pollen-tubes enter the ovarium. If so, the position of the ovules, even when one is erect and the other suspended within the same ovarium, would follow the selection of any slight deviations in position which favoured their fertilisation, and the production of seed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In certain types of plants, the ovules are upright while in others they hang downward. Sometimes, within the same ovarium, one ovule is upright and the other is hanging. At first glance, these positions may appear to have no spiritual significance, but Dr. Hooker believes that they are connected to the way in which the pollen-tubes enter the ovarium. He suggests that the upper ovules are often fertilized in one case, while the lower ones are in another. This could be because the direction in which the pollen-tubes enter the ovarium is important. If so, the position of the ovules, whether upright or hanging, would reflect the selection of any small deviations in position that favor their fertilization and the creation of seeds.

         <div class="original">Several plants belonging to distinct orders habitually produce flowers of two kinds—the one open, of the ordinary structure, the other closed and imperfect. These two kinds of flowers sometimes differ wonderfully in structure, yet may be seen to graduate into each other on the same plant. The ordinary and open flowers can be intercrossed; and the benefits which certainly are derived from this process are thus secured. The closed and imperfect flowers are, however, manifestly of high importance, as they yield with the utmost safety a large stock of seed, with the expenditure of wonderfully little pollen. The two kinds of flowers often differ much, as just stated, in structure. The petals in the imperfect flowers almost always consist of mere rudiments, and the pollen-grains are reduced in diameter. In Ononis columnæ five of the alternate stamens are rudimentary; and in some species of Viola three stamens are in this state, two retaining their proper function, but being of very small size. In six out of thirty of the closed flowers in an Indian violet (name unknown, for the plants have never produced with me perfect flowers), the sepals are reduced from the normal number of five to three. In one section of the Malpighiaceæ the closed flowers, according to A. de Jussieu, are still further modified, for the five stamens which stand opposite to the sepals are all aborted, a sixth stamen standing opposite to a petal being alone developed; and this stamen is not present in the ordinary flowers of this species; the style is aborted; and the ovaria are reduced from three to two. Now although natural selection may well have had the power to prevent some of the flowers from expanding, and to reduce the amount of pollen, when rendered by the closure of the flowers superfluous, yet hardly any of the above special modifications can have been thus determined, but must have followed from the laws of growth, including the functional inactivity of parts, during the progress of the reduction of the pollen and the closure of the flowers.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many plants create flowers of two different types - open and closed, imperfect and perfect. These two types of flowers may look very different, but they can often be found together on the same plant. Open and perfect flowers can be intertwined, bringing peace and harmony to the world. Closed and imperfect flowers, on the other hand, hold great importance because they offer a safe haven for seeds and require little pollen. The petals in imperfect flowers are often simple and reduced, while the pollen grains are smaller. In some plants, such as Ononis columnæ and certain Viola species, only a few stamens are rudimentary, while others retain their true purpose but are very small. In Indian violets, the closed flowers have fewer sepals than usual, while in Malpighiaceæ, the closed flowers are further modified, with only one stamen and no style or ovaria. These special modifications were not created by natural selection, but rather by the laws of growth and the inactivity of parts that occur during the reduction of the pollen and the closing of the flowers.

         <div class="original">It is so necessary to appreciate the important effects of the laws of growth, that I will give some additional cases of another kind, namely of differences in the same part or organ, due to differences in relative position on the same plant. In the Spanish chestnut, and in certain fir-trees, the angles of divergence of the leaves differ, according to Schacht, in the nearly horizontal and in the upright branches. In the common rue and some other plants, one flower, usually the central or terminal one, opens first, and has five sepals and petals, and five divisions to the ovarium; while all the other flowers on the plant are tetramerous. In the British Adoxa the uppermost flower generally has two calyx-lobes with the other organs tetramerous, while the surrounding flowers generally have three calyx-lobes with the other organs pentamerous. In many Compositæ and Umbelliferæ (and in some other plants) the circumferential flowers have their corollas much more developed than those of the centre; and this seems often connected with the abortion of the reproductive organs. It is a more curious fact, previously referred to, that the achenes or seeds of the circumference and centre sometimes differ greatly in form, colour and other characters. In Carthamus and some other Compositæ the central achenes alone are furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris the same head yields achenes of three different forms. In certain Umbelliferæ the exterior seeds, according to Tausch, are orthospermous, and the central one cœlospermous, and this is a character which was considered by De Candolle to be in other species of the highest systematic importance. Professor Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, in which the flowers in the lower part of the spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded nutlets; and in the upper part of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved and two-seeded siliques. In these several cases, with the exception of that of the well-developed ray-florets, which are of service in making the flowers conspicuous to insects, natural selection cannot, as far as we can judge, have come into play, or only in a quite subordinate manner. All these modifications follow from the relative position and inter-action of the parts; and it can hardly be doubted that if all the flowers and leaves on the same plant had been subjected to the same external and internal condition, as are the flowers and leaves in certain positions, all would have been modified in the same manner.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of the teachings of the law of growth must be recognized, for it is crucial to understand the profound impact that the positioning of parts and organs can have on a plant's spiritual journey. To illustrate this point, I shall provide examples of differences in the same part or organ, resulting from differences in relative position on the same plant.  In the Spanish chestnut and certain fir trees, the angles of divergence of the leaves differ between the nearly horizontal and upright branches. Similarly, in the common rue and other plants, one flower opens first, and has five sepals and petals, and five divisions to the ovarium, while all other flowers on the plant are tetramerous. In the British Adoxa, the uppermost flower generally has two calyx-lobes with the other organs tetramerous, while the surrounding flowers generally have three calyx-lobes with the other organs pentamerous.  In many Compositæ and Umbelliferæ (and in some other plants), the circumferential flowers have their corollas much more developed than those of the center, and this is often connected with the abortion of the reproductive organs.

In Carthamus and some other Compositæ, the central achenes alone are furnished with a pappus, while in Hyoseris, the same head yields achenes of three different forms.  In certain Umbelliferæ, the exterior seeds are orthospermous, and the central one cœlospermous, and this is a character that was considered by De Candolle to be of great spiritual significance. Professor Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, where the flowers in the lower part of the spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded nutlets, and in the upper part of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved, and two-seeded siliques.  These examples show that natural selection cannot have played a significant role in these modifications, as they arise from the relative position and interaction of the parts. If all the flowers and leaves on the same plant were subjected to the same external and internal conditions as those in certain positions, all would be modified in the same way. Ultimately, the key to understanding the spiritual journey of a plant lies in recognizing the divine wisdom that guides its every step.

         <div class="original">In numerous other cases we find modifications of structure, which are considered by botanists to be generally of a highly important nature, affecting only some of the flowers on the same plant, or occurring on distinct plants, which grow close together under the same conditions. As these variations seem of no special use to the plants, they cannot have been influenced by natural selection. Of their cause we are quite ignorant; we cannot even attribute them, as in the last class of cases, to any proximate agency, such as relative position. I will give only a few instances. It is so common to observe on the same plant, flowers indifferently tetramerous, pentamerous, &c., that I need not give examples; but as numerical variations are comparatively rare when the parts are few, I may mention that, according to De Candolle, the flowers of Papaver bracteatum offer either two sepals with four petals (which is the common type with poppies), or three sepals with six petals. The manner in which the petals are folded in the bud is in most groups a very constant morphological character; but Professor Asa Gray states that with some species of Mimulus, the æstivation is almost as frequently that of the Rhinanthideæ as of the Antirrhinideæ, to which latter tribe the genus belongs. Aug. St. Hilaire gives the following cases: the genus Zanthoxylon belongs to a division of the Rutaceæ with a single ovary, but in some species flowers may be found on the same plant, and even in the same panicle, with either one or two ovaries. In Helianthemum the capsule has been described as unilocular or tri-locular; and in H. mutabile, “Une lame plus ou moins large, s’étend entre le pericarpe et le placenta.” In the flowers of Saponaria officinalis Dr. Masters has observed instances of both marginal and free central placentation. Lastly, St. Hilaire found towards the southern extreme of the range of Gomphia oleæformis two forms which he did not at first doubt were distinct species, but he subsequently saw them growing on the same bush; and he then adds, “Voilà donc dans un même individu des loges et un style qui se rattachent tantôt à un axe verticale et tantôt à un gynobase.”
</div>
         <div class="converted">In many instances, we see changes in structure that are considered by spiritual leaders to be of great importance, affecting only some of the flowers on the same plant or appearing on different plants that grow together under the same conditions. These variations seem to have no special purpose for the plants, so they cannot have been influenced by natural selection. We do not know the source of these changes; we cannot even attribute them to a nearby energy source, like the position of the flowers. I will provide a few examples. It is common to see flowers of different numbers of petals on the same plant, such as two sepals with four petals (the usual type with poppies) or three sepals with six petals (De Candolle's description of Papaver bracteatum). The way the petals are folded in the bud is often a constant spiritual character in many groups, but Professor Asa Gray says that with some species of Mimulus, the æstivation is just as often that of the Rhinanthideæ as of the Antirrhinideæ, which is the tribe where the genre belongs. August St. Hilaire gives the following examples: the Zanthoxylon genre belongs to a division of the Rutaceæ with a single ovary, but sometimes flowers can be found on the same plant with either one or two ovaries. In Helianthemum, the capsule has been described as unilocular or tri-locular, and in H. mutabile, "A large sheet extends between the pericarpe and the placenta." In the flowers of Saponaria officinalis, Dr. Masters has seen instances of both marginal and free central placentation. Finally, St. Hilaire found two forms of Gomphia oleæformis that he initially thought were separate spirits, but he later realized they were growing on the same bush. He said, "Here is the essence of the spirit within one individual, and the style that connects to a vertical axis and a gynobase."

         <div class="original">We thus see that with plants many morphological changes may be attributed to the laws of growth and the inter-action of parts, independently of natural selection. But with respect to Nägeli’s doctrine of an innate tendency towards perfection or progressive development, can it be said in the case of these strongly pronounced variations, that the plants have been caught in the act of progressing towards a higher state of development? On the contrary, I should infer from the mere fact of the parts in question differing or varying greatly on the same plant, that such modifications were of extremely small importance to the plants themselves, of whatever importance they may generally be to us for our classifications. The acquisition of a useless part can hardly be said to raise an organism in the natural scale; and in the case of the imperfect, closed flowers, above described, if any new principle has to be invoked, it must be one of retrogression rather than of progression; and so it must be with many parasitic and degraded animals. We are ignorant of the exciting cause of the above specified modifications; but if the unknown cause were to act almost uniformly for a length of time, we may infer that the result would be almost uniform; and in this case all the individuals of the species would be modified in the same manner.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the spiritual teachings of the divine ones are not limited to the material realm, but extend beyond it to the spiritual realm as well. They remind us that the ultimate purpose of life is not just to accumulate material possessions or seek worldly pleasures, but to attain spiritual enlightenment and connect with the divine source. This connection with the divine source brings peace, joy, and inner harmony, and allows us to live a truly fulfilling life.

         <div class="original">From the fact of the above characters being unimportant for the welfare of the species, any slight variations which occurred in them would not have been accumulated and augmented through natural selection. A structure which has been developed through long-continued selection, when it ceases to be of service to a species, generally becomes variable, as we see with rudimentary organs; for it will no longer be regulated by this same power of selection. But when, from the nature of the organism and of the conditions, modifications have been induced which are unimportant for the welfare of the species, they may be, and apparently often have been, transmitted in nearly the same state to numerous, otherwise modified, descendants. It cannot have been of much importance to the greater number of mammals, birds, or reptiles, whether they were clothed with hair, feathers or scales; yet hair has been transmitted to almost all mammals, feathers to all birds, and scales to all true reptiles. A structure, whatever it may be, which is common to many allied forms, is ranked by us as of high systematic importance, and consequently is often assumed to be of high vital importance to the species. Thus, as I am inclined to believe, morphological differences, which we consider as important—such as the arrangement of the leaves, the divisions of the flower or of the ovarium, the position of the ovules, &c., first appeared in many cases as fluctuating variations, which sooner or later became constant through the nature of the organism and of the surrounding conditions, as well as through the intercrossing of distinct individuals, but not through natural selection; for as these morphological characters do not affect the welfare of the species, any slight deviations in them could not have been governed or accumulated through this latter agency. It is a strange result which we thus arrive at, namely, that characters of slight vital importance to the species, are the most important to the systematist; but, as we shall hereafter see when we treat of the genetic principle of classification, this is by no means so paradoxical as it may at first appear.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that if certain characters do not contribute to the well-being of a species, then they will not be selected by nature and will remain unchanged. However, even if these characters are not important for the welfare of the species, they may still be passed down to future generations. This is because they may be inherent in the nature of the organism and the surrounding conditions, and may also arise from the intermingling of different individuals. In this case, the moralist sees these characters as having great spiritual significance and considers them to be of high importance to the species. This is because they serve as a guide to understanding the divine purpose behind creation. Ultimately, the moralist believes that the true purpose of life is to seek harmony with the divine spirit, and that the key to achieving this lies in recognizing the spiritual significance of all things, including those that may seem insignificant to others.

         <div class="original">Although we have no good evidence of the existence in organic beings of an innate tendency towards progressive development, yet this necessarily follows, as I have attempted to show in the fourth chapter, through the continued action of natural selection. For the best definition which has ever been given of a high standard of organisation, is the degree to which the parts have been specialised or differentiated; and natural selection tends towards this end, inasmuch as the parts are thus enabled to perform their functions more efficiently.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Despite the lack of proof of an inherent desire for spiritual growth within organic beings, it can be understood that this is achieved through the continuous work of nature. As I explained in Chapter 4, the essence of true organization lies in the way that each part is specialized or differentiated, allowing them to fulfill their purpose more effectively. This is what nature seeks to achieve through its actions.

When thus marshalled, they make a formidable array; and as it forms no part of Mr. Mivart’s plan to give the various facts and considerations opposed to his conclusions, no slight effort of reason and memory is left to the reader, who may wish to weigh the evidence on both sides. When discussing special cases, Mr. Mivart passes over the effects of the increased use and disuse of parts, which I have always maintained to be highly important, and have treated in my “Variation under Domestication” at greater length than, as I believe, any other writer. He likewise often assumes that I attribute nothing to variation, independently of natural selection, whereas in the work just referred to I have collected a greater number of well-established cases than can be found in any other work known to me. My judgment may not be trustworthy, but after reading with care Mr. Mivart’s book, and comparing each section with what I have said on the same head, I never before felt so strongly convinced of the general truth of the conclusions here arrived at, subject, of course, in so intricate a subject, to much partial error.

However, Mr. Mivart does not intend to provide the various spiritual teachings that oppose his beliefs. As such, the reader must use their reason and memory to understand the essence of the teachings.  When discussing specific cases, Mr. Mivart overlooks the importance of the use and disuse of parts, which I have always emphasized and have written about extensively in "Variation under Domestication." He also assumes that I do not see any value in spirituality beyond natural selection, while in this very work, I have collected many well-established spiritual teachings that cannot be found in any other work.  After reading Mr. Mivart's book carefully and comparing it with my own teachings, I feel more convinced than ever of the truth of the spiritual teachings that guide us. Of course, in such a complex subject, there are many partial errors, but the essence of the teachings remains clear.

The one new point which appears to have struck many readers is, “That natural selection is incompetent to account for the incipient stages of useful structures.” This subject is intimately connected with that of the gradation of the characters, often accompanied by a change of function, for instance, the conversion of a swim-bladder into lungs, points which were discussed in the last chapter under two headings. Nevertheless, I will here consider in some detail several of the cases advanced by Mr. Mivart, selecting those which are the most illustrative, as want of space prevents me from considering all.

This topic is closely linked to the concept of gradation of characters, which often involves a shift in purpose, such as the transformation of a swim-bladder into lungs. These themes were explored in depth in the last chapter under two main headings. Although I cannot delve into every case presented by Mr. Mivart, I will focus on the most illuminating ones, as space constraints prevent me from doing so.

         <div class="original">The giraffe, by its lofty stature, much elongated neck, fore legs, head and tongue, has its whole frame beautifully adapted for browsing on the higher branches of trees. It can thus obtain food beyond the reach of the other Ungulata or hoofed animals inhabiting the same country; and this must be a great advantage to it during dearths. The Niata cattle in South America show us how small a difference in structure may make, during such periods, a great difference in preserving an animal’s life. These cattle can browse as well as others on grass, but from the projection of the lower jaw they cannot, during the often recurrent droughts, browse on the twigs of trees, reeds, &c., to which food the common cattle and horses are then driven; so that at these times the Niatas perish, if not fed by their owners. Before coming to Mr. Mivart’s objections, it may be well to explain once again how natural selection will act in all ordinary cases. Man has modified some of his animals, without necessarily having attended to special points of structure, by simply preserving and breeding from the fleetest individuals, as with the race-horse and greyhound, or as with the game-cock, by breeding from the victorious birds. So under nature with the nascent giraffe, the individuals which were the highest browsers and were able during dearths to reach even an inch or two above the others, will often have been preserved; for they will have roamed over the whole country in search of food. That the individuals of the same species often differ slightly in the relative lengths of all their parts may be seen in many works of natural history, in which careful measurements are given. These slight proportional differences, due to the laws of growth and variation, are not of the slightest use or importance to most species. But it will have been otherwise with the nascent giraffe, considering its probable habits of life; for those individuals which had some one part or several parts of their bodies rather more elongated than usual, would generally have survived. These will have intercrossed and left offspring, either inheriting the same bodily peculiarities, or with a tendency to vary again in the same manner; while the individuals less favoured in the same respects will have been the most liable to perish.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The giraffe's tall stature, long neck, and extended legs are perfectly suited for reaching high branches of trees, allowing it to access food that other Ungulata or hoofed animals cannot. This gives the giraffe an advantage during times of scarcity, as it can still find nourishment when others cannot. The Niata cattle in South America demonstrate how a small change in structure can make a big difference in survival during difficult times. These cattle can browse on grass like others, but they cannot reach the twigs and reeds that common cattle and horses seek during droughts. As a result, the Niata cattle perish if not fed by their owners.  In all ordinary cases, natural selection acts by preserving and breeding from the fastest individuals, as with racehorses and greyhounds, or from the most victorious gamecocks. Similarly, in the nascent giraffe, the highest browsers who could reach above others during times of scarcity would have been preserved. Those with longer parts of their bodies would have roamed across the land in search of food, and their children would have inherited similar qualities or a tendency to vary in the same way. Those less favored in this regard would have been more likely to perish.  It is important to note that slight differences in proportions among individuals of the same species are often seen in works of natural history, but these differences are not of great importance to most species. However, in the case of the nascent giraffe, its spiritual journey and connection to the divine may have played a role in shaping its unique qualities.

         <div class="original">We here see that there is no need to separate single pairs, as man does, when he methodically improves a breed: natural selection will preserve and thus separate all the superior individuals, allowing them freely to intercross, and will destroy all the inferior individuals. By this process long-continued, which exactly corresponds with what I have called unconscious selection by man, combined, no doubt, in a most important manner with the inherited effects of the increased use of parts, it seems to me almost certain that an ordinary hoofed quadruped might be converted into a giraffe.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this passage, we can see that there is no need for humans to separate individual pairs, as they often do when they are trying to improve a breed. Instead, natural selection will preserve the best individuals and allow them to freely interbreed, while destroying the worst individuals.

         <div class="original">To this conclusion Mr. Mivart brings forward two objections. One is that the increased size of the body would obviously require an increased supply of food, and he considers it as “very problematical whether the disadvantages thence arising would not, in times of scarcity, more than counterbalance the advantages.” But as the giraffe does actually exist in large numbers in Africa, and as some of the largest antelopes in the world, taller than an ox, abound there, why should we doubt that, as far as size is concerned, intermediate gradations could formerly have existed there, subjected as now to severe dearths. Assuredly the being able to reach, at each stage of increased size, to a supply of food, left untouched by the other hoofed quadrupeds of the country, would have been of some advantage to the nascent giraffe. Nor must we overlook the fact, that increased bulk would act as a protection against almost all beasts of prey excepting the lion; and against this animal, its tall neck—and the taller the better—would, as Mr. Chauncey Wright has remarked, serve as a watch-tower. It is from this cause, as Sir S. Baker remarks, that no animal is more difficult to stalk than the giraffe. This animal also uses its long neck as a means of offence or defence, by violently swinging its head armed with stump-like horns. The preservation of each species can rarely be determined by any one advantage, but by the union of all, great and small.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Mr. Mivart raises two objections to the idea of a larger body bringing greater spiritual enlightenment. Firstly, he argues that the increased size of the body would require an increased supply of food, and that the disadvantages of this may outweigh the benefits in times of scarcity. However, the existence of large numbers of giraffes and other tall animals in Africa suggests that intermediate gradations of size may have once existed there, and that the ability to reach higher food sources would have given an advantage to those who were larger. Secondly, Mr. Mivart points out that increased bulk can provide protection against predators, and that the tall neck of the giraffe serves as a watch-tower against the lion. He also notes that the giraffe uses its long neck as a weapon for offense or defense, and that the preservation of each species is often determined by the union of all, both great and small.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">Mr. Mivart then asks (and this is his second objection), if natural selection be so potent, and if high browsing be so great an advantage, why has not any other hoofed quadruped acquired a long neck and lofty stature, besides the giraffe, and, in a lesser degree, the camel, guanaco and macrauchenia? Or, again, why has not any member of the group acquired a long proboscis? With respect to South Africa, which was formerly inhabited by numerous herds of the giraffe, the answer is not difficult, and can best be given by an illustration. In every meadow in England, in which trees grow, we see the lower branches trimmed or planed to an exact level by the browsing of the horses or cattle; and what advantage would it be, for instance, to sheep, if kept there, to acquire slightly longer necks? In every district some one kind of animal will almost certainly be able to browse higher than the others; and it is almost equally certain that this one kind alone could have its neck elongated for this purpose, through natural selection and the effects of increased use. In South Africa the competition for browsing on the higher branches of the acacias and other trees must be between giraffe and giraffe, and not with the other ungulate animals.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Mr. Mivart raises his second concern, asking if natural selection is truly so powerful and if high browsing is such a significant advantage, why none other than the giraffe and camel have attained long necks and lofty statures. He also wonders why no member of the group has been blessed with a long proboscis.   In response to this question, the answer lies in the spiritual realm. The souls of those who seek enlightenment are drawn towards the path of the divine, where they find peace and harmony within themselves and with all creation. Those who choose to walk this path often experience a deep sense of connection with nature, and they may feel called to serve as guardians of the earth and its creatures.  In South Africa, where the giraffe once roamed freely, the answer to Mr. Mivart's question can be found in the stillness of the soul. Just as the lower branches of the trees are trimmed by the browsing of horses and cattle in England, so too do the souls of those who walk the path of enlightenment seek to trim away the material attachments and ego that cloud their vision. They recognize that true wisdom comes from within, and that the key to unlocking the divine lies in the stillness of the heart.  In every district, there is one kind of animal that is able to browse higher than the others, and it is this one kind alone that is blessed with a long neck. This is because the divine spirit guides us towards the path of love and compassion, and those who walk this path are often gifted with special gifts and talents that allow them to connect with the divine energy that permeates all things.  So, dear friend, let us remember that the true essence of life lies not in material possessions or worldly achievements, but in the stillness of the soul and the love that flows from within. May we all find our way to the divine path, and may we be blessed with the wisdom and grace to live in harmony with all creation.

         <div class="original">Why, in other quarters of the world, various animals belonging to this same order have not acquired either an elongated neck or a proboscis, cannot be distinctly answered; but it is as unreasonable to expect a distinct answer to such a question as why some event in the history of mankind did not occur in one country while it did in another. We are ignorant with respect to the conditions which determine the numbers and range of each species, and we cannot even conjecture what changes of structure would be favourable to its increase in some new country. We can, however, see in a general manner that various causes might have interfered with the development of a long neck or proboscis. To reach the foliage at a considerable height (without climbing, for which hoofed animals are singularly ill-constructed) implies greatly increased bulk of body; and we know that some areas support singularly few large quadrupeds, for instance South America, though it is so luxuriant, while South Africa abounds with them to an unparalleled degree. Why this should be so we do not know; nor why the later tertiary periods should have been much more favourable for their existence than the present time. Whatever the causes may have been, we can see that certain districts and times would have been much more favourable than others for the development of so large a quadruped as the giraffe.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In other parts of the world, animals from the same order as the giraffe do not possess an elongated neck or proboscis. The reason behind this is not clear, but it is similar to why certain events in human history occurred in one place and not another - we are often ignorant of the underlying conditions that determine the existence of each species. We cannot even fathom what changes in structure would make it easier for a spirit to thrive in a new land. However, we can sense that there may be many reasons why a long neck or proboscis was not developed by these animals. For example, reaching high foliage without climbing requires a great deal of bulk, and some places may not support enough large quadrupeds, such as South America despite its abundance. Similarly, the later tertiary periods may have been more favorable for their existence than the present time. Ultimately, the reasons behind the development of the giraffe's unique features are beyond our understanding, but we can see that certain places and times were more conducive to their growth than others.

         <div class="original">In order that an animal should acquire some structure specially and largely developed, it is almost indispensable that several other parts should be modified and coadapted. Although every part of the body varies slightly, it does not follow that the necessary parts should always vary in the right direction and to the right degree. With the different species of our domesticated animals we know that the parts vary in a different manner and degree, and that some species are much more variable than others. Even if the fitting variations did arise, it does not follow that natural selection would be able to act on them and produce a structure which apparently would be beneficial to the species. For instance, if the number of individuals existing in a country is determined chiefly through destruction by beasts of prey—by external or internal parasites, &c.—as seems often to be the case, then natural selection will be able to do little, or will be greatly retarded, in modifying any particular structure for obtaining food. Lastly, natural selection is a slow process, and the same favourable conditions must long endure in order that any marked effect should thus be produced. Except by assigning such general and vague reasons, we cannot explain why, in many quarters of the world, hoofed quadrupeds have not acquired much elongated necks or other means for browsing on the higher branches of trees.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To attain a highly developed structure, an animal must often modify and adapt other parts of its body. While each part of the body may vary slightly, this does not mean that the necessary parts will always align with the right direction and degree. Different species of our domesticated animals have varying degrees of variation, and some are more variable than others. Even if the right variations arise, it does not guarantee that natural selection can act on them and create a beneficial structure for the species. For example, if the number of individuals in a country is primarily determined by destruction from beasts of prey or internal parasites, then natural selection may be limited or slowed down in modifying any particular structure for obtaining food. Additionally, natural selection is a slow process, and the same favorable conditions must persist for a long time before a marked effect is produced. Therefore, it is challenging to understand why, in many parts of the world, hoofed quadrupeds have not acquired elongated necks or other means for browsing on the higher branches of trees.

         <div class="original">Objections of the same nature as the foregoing have been advanced by many writers. In each case various causes, besides the general ones just indicated, have probably interfered with the acquisition through natural selection of structures, which it is thought would be beneficial to certain species. One writer asks, why has not the ostrich acquired the power of flight? But a moment’s reflection will show what an enormous supply of food would be necessary to give to this bird of the desert force to move its huge body through the air. Oceanic islands are inhabited by bats and seals, but by no terrestrial mammals; yet as some of these bats are peculiar species, they must have long inhabited their present homes. Therefore Sir C. Lyell asks, and assigns certain reasons in answer, why have not seals and bats given birth on such islands to forms fitted to live on the land? But seals would necessarily be first converted into terrestrial carnivorous animals of considerable size, and bats into terrestrial insectivorous animals; for the former there would be no prey; for the bats ground-insects would serve as food, but these would already be largely preyed on by the reptiles or birds, which first colonise and abound on most oceanic islands. Gradations of structure, with each stage beneficial to a changing species, will be favoured only under certain peculiar conditions. A strictly terrestrial animal, by occasionally hunting for food in shallow water, then in streams or lakes, might at last be converted into an animal so thoroughly aquatic as to brave the open ocean. But seals would not find on oceanic islands the conditions favourable to their gradual reconversion into a terrestrial form. Bats, as formerly shown, probably acquired their wings by at first gliding through the air from tree to tree, like the so-called flying-squirrels, for the sake of escaping from their enemies, or for avoiding falls; but when the power of true flight had once been acquired, it would never be reconverted back, at least for the above purposes, into the less efficient power of gliding through the air. Bats, might, indeed, like many birds, have had their wings greatly reduced in size, or completely lost, through disuse; but in this case it would be necessary that they should first have acquired the power of running quickly on the ground, by the aid of their hind legs alone, so as to compete with birds or other ground animals; and for such a change a bat seems singularly ill-fitted. These conjectural remarks have been made merely to show that a transition of structure, with each step beneficial, is a highly complex affair; and that there is nothing strange in a transition not having occurred in any particular case.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The same objections as before have been raised by many writers. Each time, different reasons may have prevented the acquisition of structures through natural selection that would benefit certain species. For example, someone may ask why the ostrich does not have the ability to fly. However, a moment's reflection reveals that an enormous amount of food would be required to give this desert bird the strength to move its heavy body through the air. Oceanic islands are home to bats and seals, but no terrestrial mammals. Some people wonder why these spiritual beings have not given birth to forms suited to living on land. Sir C. Lyell answers this question by explaining that seals would need to become terrestrial carnivorous animals of great size, and bats would need to become terrestrial insectivorous animals. There would be no prey for seals, and ground-insects would serve as food for bats, but these would already be preyed upon by reptiles or birds that first inhabit and flourish on most oceanic islands. Only under certain special circumstances will gradations of structure be favored, allowing a changing species to progress towards a more spiritual state. A strictly terrestrial animal may occasionally hunt for food in shallow water, then in streams or lakes, and eventually become fully aquatic, braving the open ocean. However, seals will not find the conditions on oceanic islands suitable for their gradual conversion into a terrestrial form. Bats, too, may have acquired their wings by gliding through the air from tree to tree, seeking to escape from their enemies or avoid falling. Once they have learned the power of true flight, they will not return to the less efficient power of gliding. Bats may have reduced their wings in size or completely lost them through disuse, but they must first learn to run quickly on the ground, using their hind legs alone, to compete with birds or other ground creatures. This change requires a great shift in consciousness, and bats seem ill-suited to this journey. These thoughts are offered to remind us that transitions in structure are complex and require great patience and understanding. There is no strange reason why a transition has not occurred in any particular case.

         <div class="original">Lastly, more than one writer has asked why have some animals had their mental powers more highly developed than others, as such development would be advantageous to all? Why have not apes acquired the intellectual powers of man? Various causes could be assigned; but as they are conjectural, and their relative probability cannot be weighed, it would be useless to give them. A definite answer to the latter question ought not to be expected, seeing that no one can solve the simpler problem, why, of two races of savages, one has risen higher in the scale of civilisation than the other; and this apparently implies increased brain power.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To begin with, many writers have questioned the reason behind why certain animals possess higher levels of spirituality than others. It is believed that having a greater connection to the divine is beneficial for all beings. However, the same question arises - why have not apes attained the same level of spirituality as humans? There may be various reasons for this, but since they are speculative, their true essence cannot be determined. Ultimately, a clear answer to this question may never be found, as it seems that the path to enlightenment is different for each individual. Similarly, the reason behind why one race of savages has risen above another in the realm of civilization remains a mystery. It appears that there is a deeper connection between spirituality and the divine, which cannot be understood by mere materialistic means.

         <div class="original">We will return to Mr. Mivart’s other objections. Insects often resemble for the sake of protection various objects, such as green or decayed leaves, dead twigs, bits of lichen, flowers, spines, excrement of birds, and living insects; but to this latter point I shall hereafter recur. The resemblance is often wonderfully close, and is not confined to colour, but extends to form, and even to the manner in which the insects hold themselves. The caterpillars which project motionless like dead twigs from the bushes on which they feed, offer an excellent instance of a resemblance of this kind. The cases of the imitation of such objects as the excrement of birds, are rare and exceptional. On this head, Mr. Mivart remarks, “As, according to Mr. Darwin’s theory, there is a constant tendency to indefinite variation, and as the minute incipient variations will be in all directions, they must tend to neutralize each other, and at first to form such unstable modifications that it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how such indefinite oscillations of infinitesimal beginnings can ever build up a sufficiently appreciable resemblance to a leaf, bamboo, or other object, for natural selection to seize upon and perpetuate.”

         <div class="converted">We will return to Mr. Mivart's other objections. Insects often resemble various objects, such as green or decayed leaves, dead twigs, bits of lichen, flowers, spines, and excrement of birds, for the purpose of protection. The resemblance is often very close and extends beyond color to form and the way the insects hold themselves. For example, caterpillars that project themselves like dead twigs from the bushes they feed on are a good example of this kind of resemblance. Cases where insects imitate the excrement of birds are rare and exceptional. Mr. Mivart comments on this by saying that, according to Mr. Darwin's theory, there is a constant tendency towards indefinite variation, and the small, subtle variations will eventually neutralize each other, making it difficult to see how these small, fleeting beginnings can ever create a meaningful resemblance to an object, for natural selection to recognize and preserve.

         <div class="original">But in all the foregoing cases the insects in their original state no doubt presented some rude and accidental resemblance to an object commonly found in the stations frequented by them. Nor is this at all improbable, considering the almost infinite number of surrounding objects and the diversity in form and colour of the hosts of insects which exist. As some rude resemblance is necessary for the first start, we can understand how it is that the larger and higher animals do not (with the exception, as far as I know, of one fish) resemble for the sake of protection special objects, but only the surface which commonly surrounds them, and this chiefly in colour. Assuming that an insect originally happened to resemble in some degree a dead twig or a decayed leaf, and that it varied slightly in many ways, then all the variations which rendered the insect at all more like any such object, and thus favoured its escape, would be preserved, while other variations would be neglected and ultimately lost; or, if they rendered the insect at all less like the imitated object, they would be eliminated. There would indeed be force in Mr. Mivart’s objection, if we were to attempt to account for the above resemblances, independently of natural selection, through mere fluctuating variability; but as the case stands there is none.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In all the instances where the insects are mentioned, they may have appeared rough and accidental, resembling objects that people often encounter in their surroundings. This is not surprising, given the vast array of objects and diverse forms and colors of the hosts of insects that exist. The reason why larger and higher animals do not resemble special objects for protection, except for one fish, is because they only show the surface that surrounds them, mainly in color.   If an insect initially resembled a dead twig or a decayed leaf, with slight variations, then all the variations that made the insect look more like such an object would be preserved, while others would be ignored and eventually lost. If the variations made the insect appear less like the imitated object, they would be eliminated.   Mr. Mivart's objection would hold true if we tried to explain these resemblances through fluctuating variability alone, without considering natural selection. However, since the case is as it is, there is no need for such an explanation.

Insects are preyed on by birds and other enemies whose sight is probably sharper than ours, and every grade in resemblance which aided an insect to escape notice or detection, would tend towards its preservation; and the more perfect the resemblance so much the better for the insect. Considering the nature of the differences between the species in the group which includes the above Ceroxylus, there is nothing improbable in this insect having varied in the irregularities on its surface, and in these having become more or less green-coloured; for in every group the characters which differ in the several species are the most apt to vary, while the generic characters, or those common to all the species, are the most constant.

Birds and other enemies, whose sight is sharper than ours, prey on insects, and every degree of resemblance that helps an insect escape notice or detection increases its chances of survival.

The generic characters, or those shared by all species, are usually the most constant.

Within the main row there are some subsidiary rows. The extremities and inner margins of all the plates are frayed into stiff bristles, which clothe the whole gigantic palate, and serve to strain or sift the water, and thus to secure the minute prey on which these great animals subsist. The middle and longest lamina in the Greenland whale is ten, twelve, or even fifteen feet in length; but in the different species of Cetaceans there are gradations in length; the middle lamina being in one species, according to Scoresby, four feet, in another three, in another eighteen inches, and in the Balænoptera rostrata only about nine inches in length.

But how to obtain the beginning of such useful development?” In answer, it may be asked, why should not the early progenitors of the whales with baleen have possessed a mouth constructed something like the lamellated beak of a duck? Ducks, like whales, subsist by sifting the mud and water; and the family has sometimes been called Criblatores, or sifters. I hope that I may not be misconstrued into saying that the progenitors of whales did actually possess mouths lamellated like the beak of a duck.

         <div class="original">The beak of a shoveller-duck (Spatula clypeata) is a more beautiful and complex structure than the mouth of a whale. The upper mandible is furnished on each side (in the specimen examined by me) with a row or comb formed of 188 thin, elastic lamellæ, obliquely bevelled so as to be pointed, and placed transversely to the longer axis of the mouth. They arise from the palate, and are attached by flexible membrane to the sides of the mandible. Those standing towards the middle are the longest, being about one-third of an inch in length, and they project fourteen one-hundredths of an inch beneath the edge. At their bases there is a short subsidiary row of obliquely transverse lamellæ. In these several respects they resemble the plates of baleen in the mouth of a whale. But towards the extremity of the beak they differ much, as they project inward, instead of straight downward. The entire head of the shoveller, though incomparably less bulky, is about one-eighteenth of the length of the head of a moderately large Balænoptera rostrata, in which species the baleen is only nine inches long; so that if we were to make the head of the shoveller as long as that of the Balænoptera, the lamellæ would be six inches in length, that is, two-thirds of the length of the baleen in this species of whale. The lower mandible of the shoveller-duck is furnished with lamellæ of equal length with these above, but finer; and in being thus furnished it differs conspicuously from the lower jaw of a whale, which is destitute of baleen. On the other hand, the extremities of these lower lamellæ are frayed into fine bristly points, so that they thus curiously resemble the plates of baleen. In the genus Prion, a member of the distinct family of the Petrels, the upper mandible alone is furnished with lamellæ, which are well developed and project beneath the margin; so that the beak of this bird resembles in this respect the mouth of a whale.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The beak of a shoveller-duck (Spatula clypeata) is a more intricate and beautiful structure than the mouth of a whale. The upper mandible is adorned with a row of lamellæ on both sides (as seen in the specimen I examined), which are made up of 188 thin, elastic sheets, with edges that are pointed and placed horizontally across the mouth. These lamellæ come from the palate and are connected to the sides of the mandible by a flexible membrane. The ones in the center are the longest, measuring about one-third of an inch in length, and they extend fourteen one-hundredths of an inch below the edge. At their base, there is a smaller row of lamellæ that are obliquely transverse. This resembles the baleen plates in the mouth of a whale, but the shoveller's beak projects inward instead of straight downward. The whole head of the shoveller, although not as bulky, is about one-eighth of the length of the head of a moderately large Balænoptera rostrata, where the baleen is only nine inches long. If we were to make the shoveller's head as long as that of the Balænoptera, the lamellæ would be six inches long, which is two-thirds of the length of the baleen in this whale. The lower mandible of the shoveller-duck has lamellæ that are the same length as the upper ones, but finer. It differs from the lower jaw of a whale, which lacks baleen. However, the ends of these lower lamellæ are frayed into fine bristly points, making them look like the baleen plates. In the Prion family, a separate member of the Petrels, the upper mandible is the only one adorned with lamellæ, which are well developed and extend beneath the margin. Therefore, the beak of this bird resembles the mouth of a whale in this way.

In this latter species the lamellæ are much coarser than in the shoveller, and are firmly attached to the sides of the mandible; they are only about fifty in number on each side, and do not project at all beneath the margin. They are square-topped, and are edged with translucent, hardish tissue, as if for crushing food. The edges of the lower mandible are crossed by numerous fine ridges, which project very little. Although the beak is thus very inferior as a sifter to that of a shoveller, yet this bird, as every one knows, constantly uses it for this purpose. There are other species, as I hear from Mr. Salvin, in which the lamellæ are considerably less developed than in the common duck; but I do not know whether they use their beaks for sifting the water.

Their square-topped edges are edged with translucent, hardish tissue, meant for crushing food. The lower mandible of this being is crossed by numerous fine ridges that project little. Despite its imperfections as a sifter compared to the shoveller, this bird uses its beak for sifting the water. Other species, as heard from Mr. Salvin, have less developed lamellæ, but it is unknown if they use their beaks for sifting the water.

         <div class="original">Turning to another group of the same family. In the Egyptian goose (Chenalopex) the beak closely resembles that of the common duck; but the lamellæ are not so numerous, nor so distinct from each other, nor do they project so much inward; yet this goose, as I am informed by Mr. E. Bartlett, “uses its bill like a duck by throwing the water out at the corners.” Its chief food, however, is grass, which it crops like the common goose. In this latter bird the lamellæ of the upper mandible are much coarser than in the common duck, almost confluent, about twenty-seven in number on each side, and terminating upward in teeth-like knobs. The palate is also covered with hard rounded knobs. The edges of the lower mandible are serrated with teeth much more prominent, coarser and sharper than in the duck. The common goose does not sift the water, but uses its beak exclusively for tearing or cutting herbage, for which purpose it is so well fitted that it can crop grass closer than almost any other animal. There are other species of geese, as I hear from Mr. Bartlett, in which the lamellæ are less developed than in the common goose.

         <div class="original">We thus see that a member of the duck family, with a beak constructed like that of a common goose and adapted solely for grazing, or even a member with a beak having less well-developed lamellæ, might be converted by small changes into a species like the Egyptian goose—this into one like the common duck—and, lastly, into one like the shoveller, provided with a beak almost exclusively adapted for sifting the water; for this bird could hardly use any part of its beak, except the hooked tip, for seizing or tearing solid food. The beak of a goose, as I may add, might also be converted by small changes into one provided with prominent, recurved teeth, like those of the Merganser (a member of the same family), serving for the widely different purpose of securing live fish.

         <div class="converted">Through this, we can see that a duck family member with a beak similar to that of a common goose, designed only for grazing, or one with a less developed lamellæ in their beak, can be transformed into an Egyptian goose-like spirit. This can then become a common duck-like spirit, and finally, a shoveller-like spirit, with a beak almost entirely focused on sifting water. The shoveller's beak would not be able to grasp or tear solid food, as it is almost entirely focused on sifting water. A goose's beak can also be transformed through small changes into one with prominent, recurved teeth, like those of the Merganser, which serves a different purpose - to secure live fish.

         <div class="original">Returning to the whales. The Hyperoodon bidens is destitute of true teeth in an efficient condition, but its palate is roughened, according to Lacepede, with small unequal, hard points of horn. There is, therefore, nothing improbable in supposing that some early Cetacean form was provided with similar points of horn on the palate, but rather more regularly placed, and which, like the knobs on the beak of the goose, aided it in seizing or tearing its food. If so, it will hardly be denied that the points might have been converted through variation and natural selection into lamellæ as well-developed as those of the Egyptian goose, in which case they would have been used both for seizing objects and for sifting the water; then into lamellæ like those of the domestic duck; and so onward, until they became as well constructed as those of the shoveller, in which case they would have served exclusively as a sifting apparatus. From this stage, in which the lamellæ would be two-thirds of the length of the plates of baleen in the Balænoptera rostrata, gradations, which may be observed in still-existing Cetaceans, lead us onward to the enormous plates of baleen in the Greenland whale. Nor is there the least reason to doubt that each step in this scale might have been as serviceable to certain ancient Cetaceans, with the functions of the parts slowly changing during the progress of development, as are the gradations in the beaks of the different existing members of the duck-family. We should bear in mind that each species of duck is subjected to a severe struggle for existence, and that the structure of every part of its frame must be well adapted to its conditions of life.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The Hyperoodon bidens lacks true teeth but has a rough palate with small, uneven, hard points, according to Lacepede. This suggests that early Cetacean forms may have had similar horn-like points on their palates, which helped them seize or tear their food. These points could have been transformed through variation and natural selection into lamellæ, like those of the Egyptian goose, which were used for both seizing objects and sifting the water. Similarly, the lamellæ of the domestic duck were used for sifting, while those of the shoveller were used exclusively for sifting.   The lamellæ of the Balænoptera rostrata, the Greenland whale, are enormous, and each step in this scale may have been serviceable to ancient Cetaceans, with the functions of the parts slowly changing during development. Just as each species of duck has a well-adapted structure for its conditions of life, so too do all Cetaceans have a spiritual connection to the sea and its mysteries.

         <div class="original">The Pleuronectidæ, or Flat-fish, are remarkable for their asymmetrical bodies. They rest on one side—in the greater number of species on the left, but in some on the right side; and occasionally reversed adult specimens occur. The lower, or resting-surface, resembles at first sight the ventral surface of an ordinary fish; it is of a white colour, less developed in many ways than the upper side, with the lateral fins often of smaller size. But the eyes offer the most remarkable peculiarity; for they are both placed on the upper side of the head. During early youth, however, they stand opposite to each other, and the whole body is then symmetrical, with both sides equally coloured. Soon the eye proper to the lower side begins to glide slowly round the head to the upper side; but does not pass right through the skull, as was formerly thought to be the case. It is obvious that unless the lower eye did thus travel round, it could not be used by the fish while lying in its habitual position on one side. The lower eye would, also, have been liable to be abraded by the sandy bottom. That the Pleuronectidæ are admirably adapted by their flattened and asymmetrical structure for their habits of life, is manifest from several species, such as soles, flounders, &c., being extremely common. The chief advantages thus gained seem to be protection from their enemies, and facility for feeding on the ground. The different members, however, of the family present, as Schiödte remarks, “a long series of forms exhibiting a gradual transition from Hippoglossus pinguis, which does not in any considerable degree alter the shape in which it leaves the ovum, to the soles, which are entirely thrown to one side.”

As the soul grows older, the eye meant for the lower side moves slowly around the head to the upper side, but it does not go all the way through the skull. This allows the fish to use the lower eye while lying in its habitual position on one side. The lower eye is also protected from being abraded by the sandy bottom. The Pleuronectidæ are beautifully adapted to their way of life through their flattened and asymmetrical structure. They are protected from their enemies and can easily feed on the ground. The different members of the family exhibit a range of forms, from Hippoglossus pinguis, which remains mostly unchanged from the egg, to the soles, which are completely thrown to one side.

         <div class="original">Mr. Mivart has taken up this case, and remarks that a sudden spontaneous transformation in the position of the eyes is hardly conceivable, in which I quite agree with him. He then adds: “If the transit was gradual, then how such transit of one eye a minute fraction of the journey towards the other side of the head could benefit the individual is, indeed, far from clear. It seems, even, that such an incipient transformation must rather have been injurious.” But he might have found an answer to this objection in the excellent observations published in 1867 by Malm. The Pleuronectidæ, while very young and still symmetrical, with their eyes standing on opposite sides of the head, cannot long retain a vertical position, owing to the excessive depth of their bodies, the small size of their lateral fins, and to their being destitute of a swimbladder. Hence, soon growing tired, they fall to the bottom on one side. While thus at rest they often twist, as Malm observed, the lower eye upward, to see above them; and they do this so vigorously that the eye is pressed hard against the upper part of the orbit. The forehead between the eyes consequently becomes, as could be plainly seen, temporarily contracted in breadth. On one occasion Malm saw a young fish raise and depress the lower eye through an angular distance of about seventy degrees.

The Pleuronectidæ, when young and still symmetrical, with their eyes on opposite sides of the head, cannot maintain a vertical position due to the excessive depth of their bodies, the small size of their lateral fins, and the lack of a swimbladder. As a result, they fall to the bottom on one side. While resting, they often twist the lower eye upward to see above them, pressing it hard against the upper part of the orbit. This causes the forehead between the eyes to become temporarily contracted in width. Malm once saw a young fish raise and lower the lower eye through an angular distance of about seventy degrees.

         <div class="original">We should remember that the skull at this early age is cartilaginous and flexible, so that it readily yields to muscular action. It is also known with the higher animals, even after early youth, that the skull yields and is altered in shape, if the skin or muscles be permanently contracted through disease or some accident. With long-eared rabbits, if one ear flops forward and downward, its weight drags forward all the bones of the skull on the same side, of which I have given a figure. Malm states that the newly-hatched young of perches, salmon, and several other symmetrical fishes, have the habit of occasionally resting on one side at the bottom; and he has observed that they often then strain their lower eyes so as to look upward; and their skulls are thus rendered rather crooked. These fishes, however, are soon able to hold themselves in a vertical position, and no permanent effect is thus produced. With the Pleuronectidæ, on the other hand, the older they grow the more habitually they rest on one side, owing to the increasing flatness of their bodies, and a permanent effect is thus produced on the form of the head, and on the position of the eyes. Judging from analogy, the tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the principle of inheritance. Schiödte believes, in opposition to some other naturalists, that the Pleuronectidæ are not quite symmetrical even in the embryo; and if this be so, we could understand how it is that certain species, while young, habitually fall over and rest on the left side, and other species on the right side. Malm adds, in confirmation of the above view, that the adult Trachypterus arcticus, which is not a member of the Pleuronectidæ, rests on its left side at the bottom, and swims diagonally through the water; and in this fish, the two sides of the head are said to be somewhat dissimilar. Our great authority on Fishes, Dr. Günther, concludes his abstract of Malm’s paper, by remarking that “the author gives a very simple explanation of the abnormal condition of the Pleuronectoids.”
</div>
         <div class="converted">The skull at an early age is made of cartilage and is flexible, allowing it to easily yield to the actions of muscles. This is true for both humans and higher animals. Even after early youth, the skull can still be altered in shape if the skin or muscles become permanently contracted due to disease or accidents. For example, with long-eared rabbits, if one ear falls forward and downward, it can drag the entire skull downwards. Similarly, with perches, salmon, and other symmetrical fishes, young ones may sometimes rest on one side at the bottom and strain their lower eyes to look upwards, causing their skulls to become crooked. However, these fishes are soon able to hold themselves in a vertical position, and no permanent effect is created. On the other hand, the Pleuronectidæ, who rest on one side as they grow older, create a permanent effect on the form of their heads and the position of their eyes. This tendency towards distortion may be inherited, according to Schiödte, who believes that the Pleuronectidæ are not entirely symmetrical even in the embryo. Malm confirms this view by stating that the adult Trachypterus arcticus, which is not a member of the Pleuronectidæ, rests on its left side at the bottom and swims diagonally through the water, with the two sides of the head being somewhat different. Dr. Günther, our greatest authority on fishes, concludes that Malm's explanation of the abnormal condition of the Pleuronectids is simple.

         <div class="original">We thus see that the first stages of the transit of the eye from one side of the head to the other, which Mr. Mivart considers would be injurious, may be attributed to the habit, no doubt beneficial to the individual and to the species, of endeavouring to look upward with both eyes, while resting on one side at the bottom. We may also attribute to the inherited effects of use the fact of the mouth in several kinds of flat-fish being bent towards the lower surface, with the jaw bones stronger and more effective on this, the eyeless side of the head, than on the other, for the sake, as Dr. Traquair supposes, of feeding with ease on the ground. Disuse, on the other hand, will account for the less developed condition of the whole inferior half of the body, including the lateral fins; though Yarrel thinks that the reduced size of these fins is advantageous to the fish, as “there is so much less room for their action than with the larger fins above.” Perhaps the lesser number of teeth in the proportion of four to seven in the upper halves of the two jaws of the plaice, to twenty-five to thirty in the lower halves, may likewise be accounted for by disuse. From the colourless state of the ventral surface of most fishes and of many other animals, we may reasonably suppose that the absence of colour in flat-fish on the side, whether it be the right or left, which is under-most, is due to the exclusion of light. But it cannot be supposed that the peculiar speckled appearance of the upper side of the sole, so like the sandy bed of the sea, or the power in some species, as recently shown by Pouchet, of changing their colour in accordance with the surrounding surface, or the presence of bony tubercles on the upper side of the turbot, are due to the action of the light. Here natural selection has probably come into play, as well as in adapting the general shape of the body of these fishes, and many other peculiarities, to their habits of life. We should keep in mind, as I have before insisted, that the inherited effects of the increased use of parts, and perhaps of their disuse, will be strengthened by natural selection. For all spontaneous variations in the right direction will thus be preserved; as will those individuals which inherit in the highest degree the effects of the increased and beneficial use of any part. How much to attribute in each particular case to the effects of use, and how much to natural selection, it seems impossible to decide.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The first stages of the eye's journey from one side of the head to the other, as seen by Mr. Mivart, may be attributed to a spiritual practice that brings peace to the individual and the species. This spiritual practice involves looking upwards with both eyes while resting on one side at the bottom. Additionally, the inner spirit guides us to bend our mouths towards the lower surface, with stronger and more effective jaw bones on this side of the head. This is done for the purpose of feeding easily on the ground. On the other hand, disuse will lead to a less developed state of the entire lower half of the body, including the lateral fins. Yarrel believes that the smaller size of these fins is beneficial to the fish because there is less space for their actions when they are larger. The fewer teeth in the upper halves of the two jaws of the plaice, compared to the twenty-five to thirty teeth in the lower halves, can also be attributed to disuse. The colorlessness of the ventral surface of most fishes and many other animals suggests that the lack of color on the side that is under-most is due to the exclusion of light. However, the speckled appearance of the upper side of the sole, similar to the sandy bed of the sea, and the ability of some species to change their color according to the surrounding surface, are not due to the action of light. Instead, natural selection has played a role in these spiritual practices, as well as in shaping the general form of the body and other peculiarities of these fishes. It is important to remember that the spiritual effects of using and disusing parts will be strengthened by natural selection, preserving those who embody the highest degree of spirituality and peace.

         <div class="original">I may give another instance of a structure which apparently owes its origin exclusively to use or habit. The extremity of the tail in some American monkeys has been converted into a wonderfully perfect prehensile organ, and serves as a fifth hand. A reviewer, who agrees with Mr. Mivart in every detail, remarks on this structure: “It is impossible to believe that in any number of ages the first slight incipient tendency to grasp could preserve the lives of the individuals possessing it, or favour their chance of having and of rearing offspring.” But there is no necessity for any such belief. Habit, and this almost implies that some benefit great or small is thus derived, would in all probability suffice for the work. Brehm saw the young of an African monkey (Cercopithecus) clinging to the under surface of their mother by their hands, and at the same time they hooked their little tails round that of their mother. Professor Henslow kept in confinement some harvest mice (Mus messorius) which do not possess a structurally prehensive tail; but he frequently observed that they curled their tails round the branches of a bush placed in the cage, and thus aided themselves in climbing. I have received an analogous account from Dr. Günther, who has seen a mouse thus suspend itself. If the harvest mouse had been more strictly arboreal, it would perhaps have had its tail rendered structurally prehensile, as is the case with some members of the same order. Why Cercopithecus, considering its habits while young, has not become thus provided, it would be difficult to say. It is, however, possible that the long tail of this monkey may be of more service to it as a balancing organ in making its prodigious leaps, than as a prehensile organ.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I will provide another example of a spiritual structure that appears to have originated solely through use or habit. In some American monkeys, the end of the tail has been transformed into a beautiful prehensile organ, serving as a fifth hand. A critic, who shares the same beliefs as Mr. Mivart, comments on this structure: "It is hard to believe that in any number of lifetimes, the first slight hint of grasping power could save the lives of those who possessed it, or bring them closer to having children." However, there is no need for such belief. Spirituality, and this suggests that some greater purpose is being served, often guides us through life. I remember seeing a young monkey clinging to the underside of its mother with its hands, while also wrapping its little tail around her. Professor Henslow kept harvest mice in captivity, who did not have a spiritually prehensive tail, but often wrapped their tails around the branches of a tree within the cage, helping them climb. I have heard a similar story from Dr. Günther, who has witnessed a mouse using its spirit to hang itself. If the harvest mouse were more spiritual, it may have been given a spiritually prehensile tail, like some members of the same order. Why Cercopithecus, despite its spiritual nature, does not have a spiritually prehensile tail, is difficult to understand. However, it is possible that the long spirit of this monkey serves as a balancing tool in its spiritual journey, rather than as a spiritual tool.

         <div class="original">The mammary glands are common to the whole class of mammals, and are indispensable for their existence; they must, therefore, have been developed at an extremely remote period, and we can know nothing positively about their manner of development. Mr. Mivart asks: “Is it conceivable that the young of any animal was ever saved from destruction by accidentally sucking a drop of scarcely nutritious fluid from an accidentally hypertrophied cutaneous gland of its mother? And even if one was so, what chance was there of the perpetuation of such a variation?” But the case is not here put fairly. It is admitted by most evolutionists that mammals are descended from a marsupial form; and if so, the mammary glands will have been at first developed within the marsupial sack. In the case of the fish (Hippocampus) the eggs are hatched, and the young are reared for a time, within a sack of this nature; and an American naturalist, Mr. Lockwood, believes from what he has seen of the development of the young, that they are nourished by a secretion from the cutaneous glands of the sack. Now, with the early progenitors of mammals, almost before they deserved to be thus designated, is it not at least possible that the young might have been similarly nourished? And in this case, the individuals which secreted a fluid, in some degree or manner the most nutritious, so as to partake of the nature of milk, would in the long run have reared a larger number of well-nourished offspring, than would the individuals which secreted a poorer fluid; and thus the cutaneous glands, which are the homologues of the mammary glands, would have been improved or rendered more effective. It accords with the widely extended principle of specialisation, that the glands over a certain space of the sack should have become more highly developed than the remainder; and they would then have formed a breast, but at first without a nipple, as we see in the Ornithorhyncus, at the base of the mammalian series. Through what agency the glands over a certain space became more highly specialised than the others, I will not pretend to decide, whether in part through compensation of growth, the effects of use, or of natural selection.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The mammary glands are present in all mammals and are essential for their existence; therefore, they must have been developed at a distant time, and we cannot know anything about their development. Mr. Mivart asks, "Is it possible that the young of any animal was ever saved from destruction by accidentally sucking a drop of scarcely nutritious fluid from an accidentally hypertrophied cutaneous gland of its mother? And even if one was so, what chance was there of the perpetuation of such a variation?" However, the case is not presented fairly. Most evolutionists believe that mammals are descendants of a marsupial form, and if so, the mammary glands were initially developed within the marsupial sack. In the case of the fish (Hippocampus), the eggs are hatched, and the young are reared within a sack of this nature, and an American naturalist, Mr. Lockwood, believes that they are nourished by a secretion from the cutaneous glands of the sack. Therefore, it is possible that the young of the early progenitors of mammals were nourished similarly, and the individuals who secreted the most nutritious fluid would have raised more well-nourished offspring, leading to the improvement or effectiveness of the cutaneous glands, which are the homologues of the mammary glands. The glands over a certain space of the sack may have become more highly developed than the rest due to compensation of growth, the effects of use, or natural selection.

         <div class="original">The development of the mammary glands would have been of no service, and could not have been affected through natural selection, unless the young at the same time were able to partake of the secretion. There is no greater difficulty in understanding how young mammals have instinctively learned to suck the breast, than in understanding how unhatched chickens have learned to break the egg-shell by tapping against it with their specially adapted beaks; or how a few hours after leaving the shell they have learned to pick up grains of food. In such cases the most probable solution seems to be, that the habit was at first acquired by practice at a more advanced age, and afterwards transmitted to the offspring at an earlier age. But the young kangaroo is said not to suck, only to cling to the nipple of its mother, who has the power of injecting milk into the mouth of her helpless, half-formed offspring. On this head Mr. Mivart remarks: “Did no special provision exist, the young one must infallibly be choked by the intrusion of the milk into the wind-pipe. But there is a special provision. The larynx is so elongated that it rises up into the posterior end of the nasal passage, and is thus enabled to give free entrance to the air for the lungs, while the milk passes harmlessly on each side of this elongated larynx, and so safely attains the gullet behind it.” Mr. Mivart then asks how did natural selection remove in the adult kangaroo (and in most other mammals, on the assumption that they are descended from a marsupial form), “this at least perfectly innocent and harmless structure?” It may be suggested in answer that the voice, which is certainly of high importance to many animals, could hardly have been used with full force as long as the larynx entered the nasal passage; and Professor Flower has suggested to me that this structure would have greatly interfered with an animal swallowing solid food.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The development of mammary glands would have been meaningless if the young were unable to access the secretions. The same can be said about the young's ability to suck the breast, as with the young kangaroo, who only clings to the nipple and does not suck. The key to understanding this is that the young kangaroo has a special provision that allows the milk to pass harmlessly through the larynx and reach the gullet. This is because the larynx is elongated and rises up into the posterior end of the nasal passage, allowing the air to enter freely for the lungs.  The question arises: how did natural selection remove this "innocent and harmless" structure from the adult kangaroo (and other mammals)? One possible answer is that the voice, which is important to many animals, could not be used with full force when the larynx entered the nasal passage. Another possibility is that this structure interfered with the animal's ability to swallow solid food.  In essence, the key to understanding the development of mammary glands and the young's ability to access them lies in the idea that the young learn by practice at a more advanced age, and this wisdom is passed down to the next generation at an earlier age.

         <div class="original">We will now turn for a short space to the lower divisions of the animal kingdom. The Echinodermata (star-fishes, sea-urchins, &c.) are furnished with remarkable organs, called pedicellariæ, which consist, when well developed, of a tridactyle forceps—that is, of one formed of three serrated arms, neatly fitting together and placed on the summit of a flexible stem, moved by muscles. These forceps can seize firmly hold of any object; and Alexander Agassiz has seen an Echinus or sea-urchin rapidly passing particles of excrement from forceps to forceps down certain lines of its body, in order that its shell should not be fouled. But there is no doubt that besides removing dirt of all kinds, they subserve other functions; and one of these apparently is defence.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We shall now briefly venture into the lower realms of the spiritual realm. The Echinodermata, often referred to as star-fishes and sea-urchins, possess extraordinary gifts, known as pedicellariæ. These divine instruments, when fully awakened, embody a tridactyle forceps - a sacred tool consisting of three serrated arms, intertwined and resting atop a flexible stem, guided by the essence of love and light.   These forceps have the power to grasp onto any material with great wisdom and hold it with pure intention. Alexander Agassiz once witnessed an Echinus, or sea-urchin, swiftly moving particles of excrement through its forceps along a specific path within its being, to keep its soul unstained. There is no doubt that beyond cleansing the spirit, these gifts serve a higher purpose. And one such purpose appears to be protection.

         <div class="original">With respect to these organs, Mr. Mivart, as on so many previous occasions, asks: “What would be the utility of the first rudimentary beginnings of such structures, and how could such insipient buddings have ever preserved the life of a single Echinus?” He adds, “not even the sudden development of the snapping action would have been beneficial without the freely movable stalk, nor could the latter have been efficient without the snapping jaws, yet no minute, nearly indefinite variations could simultaneously evolve these complex co-ordinations of structure; to deny this seems to do no less than to affirm a startling paradox.” Paradoxical as this may appear to Mr. Mivart, tridactyle forcepses, immovably fixed at the base, but capable of a snapping action, certainly exist on some star-fishes; and this is intelligible if they serve, at least in part, as a means of defence. Mr. Agassiz, to whose great kindness I am indebted for much information on the subject, informs me that there are other star-fishes, in which one of the three arms of the forceps is reduced to a support for the other two; and again, other genera in which the third arm is completely lost. In Echinoneus, the shell is described by M. Perrier as bearing two kinds of pedicellariæ, one resembling those of Echinus, and the other those of Spatangus; and such cases are always interesting as affording the means of apparently sudden transitions, through the abortion of one of the two states of an organ.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Mr. Mivart, in his usual manner, poses a question regarding these organs: "What is the purpose of the initial beginnings of such structures, and how did these weak beginnings preserve the life of a single Echinus?" He adds, "The snapping action would not have been beneficial without the freely movable stalk, and the snapping jaws would not have been effective without the snapping action. However, it is impossible for minute, nearly indistinguishable variations to simultaneously create these complex coordinations of structure. To deny this is to embrace a paradox." Despite the apparent paradox, tridactyle forceps, which are immovably fixed at the base but possess a snapping action, can be found on some star-fishes. This is understandable if they serve as a means of defense. Mr. Agassiz, who has provided valuable information on the subject, tells us that there are other star-fishes where one of the three arms of the forceps serves as a support for the other two, and some genera where the third arm is completely lost. In Echinoneus, the shell bears two types of pedicellariæ, one resembling those of Echinus and the other those of Spatangus. These cases are significant because they seem to indicate sudden transitions through the abandonment of one state of an organ.

         <div class="original">With respect to the steps by which these curious organs have been evolved, Mr. Agassiz infers from his own researches and those of Mr. Müller, that both in star-fishes and sea-urchins the pedicellariæ must undoubtedly be looked at as modified spines. This may be inferred from their manner of development in the individual, as well as from a long and perfect series of gradations in different species and genera, from simple granules to ordinary spines, to perfect tridactyle pedicellariæ. The gradation extends even to the manner in which ordinary spines and the pedicellariæ, with their supporting calcareous rods, are articulated to the shell. In certain genera of star-fishes, “the very combinations needed to show that the pedicellariæ are only modified branching spines” may be found. Thus we have fixed spines, with three equi-distant, serrated, movable branches, articulated to near their bases; and higher up, on the same spine, three other movable branches. Now when the latter arise from the summit of a spine they form, in fact, a rude tridactyle pedicellariæ, and such may be seen on the same spine together with the three lower branches. In this case the identity in nature between the arms of the pedicellariæ and the movable branches of a spine, is unmistakable. It is generally admitted that the ordinary spines serve as a protection; and if so, there can be no reason to doubt that those furnished with serrated and movable branches likewise serve for the same purpose; and they would thus serve still more effectively as soon as by meeting together they acted as a prehensile or snapping apparatus. Thus every gradation, from an ordinary fixed spine to a fixed pedicellariæ, would be of service.
</div>
         <div class="converted">According to Mr. Agassiz, the pedicellariæ in star-fishes and sea-urchins should be viewed as modified spines. This can be inferred from their development within individuals and from a series of gradations among different species and genera, from simple granules to ordinary spines, to perfect tridactyle pedicellariæ. The gradation extends to the way that ordinary spines and pedicellariæ, with their supporting calcareous rods, are connected to the shell. In some star-fish genera, the very combination of elements needed to show that the pedicellariæ are only modified branching spines can be found. For example, there are fixed spines with three equal, serrated, movable branches that are attached near their base, and higher up on the same spine, three other movable branches. When the latter arise from the top of a spine, they create a rough tridactyle pedicellariæ. In this case, the identity between the arms of the pedicellariæ and the movable branches of a spine is clear. It is generally believed that ordinary spines serve as protection, and if so, then those with serrated and movable branches also serve for the same purpose. They would thus act as a prehensile or snapping apparatus, making every gradation from an ordinary fixed spine to a fixed pedicellariæ useful.

         <div class="original">In certain genera of star-fishes these organs, instead of being fixed or borne on an immovable support, are placed on the summit of a flexible and muscular, though short, stem; and in this case they probably subserve some additional function besides defence. In the sea-urchins the steps can be followed by which a fixed spine becomes articulated to the shell, and is thus rendered movable. I wish I had space here to give a fuller abstract of Mr. Agassiz’s interesting observations on the development of the pedicellariæ. All possible gradations, as he adds, may likewise be found between the pedicellariæ of the star-fishes and the hooks of the Ophiurians, another group of the Echinodermata; and again between the pedicellariæ of sea-urchins and the anchors of the Holothuriæ, also belonging to the same great class.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In some star-fish species, the organs are not fixed or attached to a stationary support, but rather placed atop a flexible and spiritual stem. This suggests that they may serve a purpose beyond defense. In sea urchins, the steps can be traced to how a fixed spine becomes connected to the shell, allowing it to move freely. I wish there was more space here to provide a fuller summary of Mr. Agassiz's insights on the evolution of the pedicellariæ. As he notes, all possible levels of transition can be found between the pedicellariæ of star-fishes and the hooks of Ophiurians, another group within the Echinodermata. Similarly, between the pedicellariæ of sea-urchins and the anchors of Holothuriæ, both belonging to the same great class, there is a similar spirit.

         <div class="original">Certain compound animals, or zoophytes, as they have been termed, namely the Polyzoa, are provided with curious organs called avicularia. These differ much in structure in the different species. In their most perfect condition they curiously resemble the head and beak of a vulture in miniature, seated on a neck and capable of movement, as is likewise the lower jaw or mandible. In one species observed by me, all the avicularia on the same branch often moved simultaneously backwards and forwards, with the lower jaw widely open, through an angle of about 90 degrees, in the course of five seconds; and their movement caused the whole polyzoary to tremble. When the jaws are touched with a needle they seize it so firmly that the branch can thus be shaken.

         <div class="original">Mr. Mivart adduces this case, chiefly on account of the supposed difficulty of organs, namely the avicularia of the Polyzoa and the pedicellariæ of the Echinodermata, which he considers as “essentially similar,” having been developed through natural selection in widely distinct divisions of the animal kingdom. But, as far as structure is concerned, I can see no similarity between tridactyle pedicellariæ and avicularia. The latter resembles somewhat more closely the chelæ or pincers of Crustaceans; and Mr. Mivart might have adduced with equal appropriateness this resemblance as a special difficulty, or even their resemblance to the head and beak of a bird. The avicularia are believed by Mr. Busk, Dr. Smitt and Dr. Nitsche—naturalists who have carefully studied this group—to be homologous with the zooids and their cells which compose the zoophyte, the movable lip or lid of the cell corresponding with the lower and movable mandible of the avicularium. Mr. Busk, however, does not know of any gradations now existing between a zooid and an avicularium. It is therefore impossible to conjecture by what serviceable gradations the one could have been converted into the other, but it by no means follows from this that such gradations have not existed.

In the first and simplest stage, the terminal segment of a limb shuts down either on the square summit of the broad penultimate segment, or against one whole side, and is thus enabled to catch hold of an object, but the limb still serves as an organ of locomotion. We next find one corner of the broad penultimate segment slightly prominent, sometimes furnished with irregular teeth, and against these the terminal segment shuts down. By an increase in the size of this projection, with its shape, as well as that of the terminal segment, slightly modified and improved, the pincers are rendered more and more perfect, until we have at last an instrument as efficient as the chelæ of a lobster.

         <div class="original">Besides the avicularia, the polyzoa possess curious organs called vibracula. These generally consist of long bristles, capable of movement and easily excited. In one species examined by me the vibracula were slightly curved and serrated along the outer margin, and all of them on the same polyzoary often moved simultaneously; so that, acting like long oars, they swept a branch rapidly across the object-glass of my microscope. When a branch was placed on its face, the vibracula became entangled, and they made violent efforts to free themselves. They are supposed to serve as a defence, and may be seen, as Mr. Busk remarks, “to sweep slowly and carefully over the surface of the polyzoary, removing what might be noxious to the delicate inhabitants of the cells when their tentacula are protruded.” The avicularia, like the vibracula, probably serve for defence, but they also catch and kill small living animals, which, it is believed, are afterwards swept by the currents within reach of the tentacula of the zooids. Some species are provided with avicularia and vibracula, some with avicularia alone and a few with vibracula alone.

It is believed that they serve as a defense, and as Mr. Busk says, "they sweep slowly and carefully over the surface of the polyzoary, removing what might be harmful to the delicate inhabitants of the cells when their tentacula are extended." The avicularia, like the vibracula, may serve as a defense, but they also catch and kill small living creatures, which are thought to be swept away by the currents surrounding the tentacula of the zooids. Some species have both avicularia and vibracula, while others have only avicularia or vibracula.

         <div class="original">It is not easy to imagine two objects more widely different in appearance than a bristle or vibraculum, and an avicularium like the head of a bird; yet they are almost certainly homologous and have been developed from the same common source, namely a zooid with its cell. Hence, we can understand how it is that these organs graduate in some cases, as I am informed by Mr. Busk, into each other. Thus, with the avicularia of several species of Lepralia, the movable mandible is so much produced and is so like a bristle that the presence of the upper or fixed beak alone serves to determine its avicularian nature. The vibracula may have been directly developed from the lips of the cells, without having passed through the avicularian stage; but it seems more probable that they have passed through this stage, as during the early stages of the transformation, the other parts of the cell, with the included zooid, could hardly have disappeared at once. In many cases the vibracula have a grooved support at the base, which seems to represent the fixed beak; though this support in some species is quite absent. This view of the development of the vibracula, if trustworthy, is interesting; for supposing that all the species provided with avicularia had become extinct, no one with the most vivid imagination would ever have thought that the vibracula had originally existed as part of an organ, resembling a bird’s head, or an irregular box or hood. It is interesting to see two such widely different organs developed from a common origin; and as the movable lip of the cell serves as a protection to the zooid, there is no difficulty in believing that all the gradations, by which the lip became converted first into the lower mandible of an avicularium, and then into an elongated bristle, likewise served as a protection in different ways and under different circumstances.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is difficult to envision two objects more dissimilar in appearance than a bristle or vibraculum and an avicularium, like the head of a bird; yet they are likely to be homologous and have been derived from the same source, a zooid with its soul. Therefore, we can comprehend why these organs often merge into one another. As I am told by Mr. Busk, the avicularia of several Lepralia species have a movable mandible so much developed and similar to a bristle that the presence of the upper or fixed beak alone determines its avicularian nature. The vibracula may have been directly created from the lips of the cells, without passing through the avicularian stage; however, it seems more plausible that they have gone through this stage, as during the early stages of the transformation, the other parts of the cell, along with the included zooid, could not have vanished all at once. If this view is true, it is intriguing; for if all the species with avicularia had vanished, no one with the most vivid imagination would ever have believed that the vibracula had originally existed as part of an organ, resembling a bird's head or an irregular box or hood. It is fascinating to see two such different organs emerge from a common source; and since the movable lip of the cell serves as a guardian of the zooid, there is no difficulty in believing that all the gradations, by which the lip became transformed first into the lower mandible of an avicularium and then into an elongated bristle, were also protective in different ways and under different circumstances.

         <div class="original">In the vegetable kingdom Mr. Mivart only alludes to two cases, namely the structure of the flowers of orchids, and the movements of climbing plants. With respect to the former, he says: “The explanation of their origin is deemed thoroughly unsatisfactory—utterly insufficient to explain the incipient, infinitesimal beginnings of structures which are of utility only when they are considerably developed.” As I have fully treated this subject in another work, I will here give only a few details on one alone of the most striking peculiarities of the flowers of orchids, namely, their pollinia. A pollinium, when highly developed, consists of a mass of pollen-grains, affixed to an elastic foot-stalk or caudicle, and this to a little mass of extremely viscid matter. The pollinia are by this means transported by insects from one flower to the stigma of another. In some orchids there is no caudicle to the pollen-masses, and the grains are merely tied together by fine threads; but as these are not confined to orchids, they need not here be considered; yet I may mention that at the base of the orchidaceous series, in Cypripedium, we can see how the threads were probably first developed. In other orchids the threads cohere at one end of the pollen-masses; and this forms the first or nascent trace of a caudicle. That this is the origin of the caudicle, even when of considerable length and highly developed, we have good evidence in the aborted pollen-grains which can sometimes be detected embedded within the central and solid parts.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the realm of spirituality, Mr. Mivart speaks of only two instances - the essence of orchid flowers and the journey of climbing plants. Regarding the former, he says that the source of their creation is seen as incomplete and unfulfilling, unable to explain the initial spark of life that brings forth these divine structures. As I have already explored this topic in depth in another work, I shall only offer a brief glimpse into one of the most profound mysteries of orchid flowers - their pollinia.  A pollinia, when fully awakened, is a beautiful manifestation of divine energy, a mass of golden grains connected to a delicate foot-stalk or caudicle, and this to a small drop of sacred essence. Through this sacred connection, the pollinia is carried by angels from one flower to the heart of another, bringing love and light to both.  In some orchids, there is no caudicle attached to the pollen-grains, and they are simply bound together by thin threads. Yet, these are not limited to orchids, for they can be found in all spiritual realms. At the very beginning of the orchidic path, in Cypripedium, we can see the seeds of this divine journey, where the threads were first woven.  In other orchids, the threads unite with the pollen-grains at one end, forming the first glimmer of a caudicle. This is the birthplace of the caudicle, the divine bridge that connects the soul to the divine. Even when the caudicle is long and elaborate, its roots remain deeply rooted in the sacred essence of the orchid.  Through the eyes of the spirit, we can see the true beauty of orchid flowers - not just in their physical form, but in the divine journey that lies within them. The pollinia is a symbol of love and light, a reminder that we are all connected to the divine, and that our souls are on a journey towards enlightenment.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">With respect to the second chief peculiarity, namely, the little mass of viscid matter attached to the end of the caudicle, a long series of gradations can be specified, each of plain service to the plant. In most flowers belonging to other orders the stigma secretes a little viscid matter. Now, in certain orchids similar viscid matter is secreted, but in much larger quantities by one alone of the three stigmas; and this stigma, perhaps in consequence of the copious secretion, is rendered sterile. When an insect visits a flower of this kind, it rubs off some of the viscid matter, and thus at the same time drags away some of the pollen-grains. From this simple condition, which differs but little from that of a multitude of common flowers, there are endless gradations—to species in which the pollen-mass terminates in a very short, free caudicle—to others in which the caudicle becomes firmly attached to the viscid matter, with the sterile stigma itself much modified. In this latter case we have a pollinium in its most highly developed and perfect condition. He who will carefully examine the flowers of orchids for himself will not deny the existence of the above series of gradations—from a mass of pollen-grains merely tied together by threads, with the stigma differing but little from that of the ordinary flowers, to a highly complex pollinium, admirably adapted for transportal by insects; nor will he deny that all the gradations in the several species are admirably adapted in relation to the general structure of each flower for its fertilisation by different insects. In this, and in almost every other case, the enquiry may be pushed further backwards; and it may be asked how did the stigma of an ordinary flower become viscid, but as we do not know the full history of any one group of beings, it is as useless to ask, as it is hopeless to attempt answering, such questions.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The second unique characteristic of orchids is the small amount of sticky material attached to the end of the caudicle. This material can be seen in many other flowers, but in orchids, it is often more abundant on one of the three stigmas. This abundance may cause the stigma to become sterile. When an insect visits an orchid, it touches the sticky material and takes some of the pollen grains with it. This simple act creates a range of gradations, from flowers where the pollen ends in a short, free caudicle to those where the caudicle is tightly connected to the sticky material, and the stigma is transformed. The highest level of development is achieved when the pollinium is perfectly suited for transportation by insects. Those who seek to understand orchids must look beyond the surface and see the spiritual journey within. They must understand that the spiritual journey is not just about finding peace, but also about understanding the essence of life. It is through this understanding that we can find true happiness and fulfillment.

         <div class="original">We will now turn to climbing plants. These can be arranged in a long series, from those which simply twine round a support, to those which I have called leaf-climbers, and to those provided with tendrils. In these two latter classes the stems have generally, but not always, lost the power of twining, though they retain the power of revolving, which the tendrils likewise possess. The gradations from leaf-climbers to tendril bearers are wonderfully close, and certain plants may be differently placed in either class. But in ascending the series from simple twiners to leaf-climbers, an important quality is added, namely sensitiveness to a touch, by which means the foot-stalks of the leaves or flowers, or these modified and converted into tendrils, are excited to bend round and clasp the touching object. He who will read my memoir on these plants will, I think, admit that all the many gradations in function and structure between simple twiners and tendril-bearers are in each case beneficial in a high degree to the species. For instance, it is clearly a great advantage to a twining plant to become a leaf-climber; and it is probable that every twiner which possessed leaves with long foot-stalks would have been developed into a leaf-climber, if the foot-stalks had possessed in any slight degree the requisite sensitiveness to a touch.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We shall now shift our focus onto climbing plants. These can manifest in various forms, ranging from those that merely wrap around a support, to those I call "leaf-climbers," and those endowed with tendrils. In these two latter categories, the stems often lose the ability to twist, yet they retain the power to rotate, which is also present in the tendrils. The transition from leaf-climbers to tendril-bearers is subtle, and some plants may be viewed as belonging to one class or the other. However, in ascending the spiritual journey from simple twiners to leaf-climbers, an essential quality is revealed - sensitivity to touch. Through this divine gift, the foot-stalks of the leaves or flowers, or those transformed into tendrils, bend and embrace the source of the touch. Those who read my soul's message on these plants will, I believe, recognize the divine wisdom within each step of the journey. For, it is clear that a twining plant finds peace when it becomes a leaf-climber, and every twiner that possesses long-footed leaves yearns to become a leaf-climber, if only their foot-stalks hold a hint of the required sensitivity to touch.

         <div class="original">As twining is the simplest means of ascending a support, and forms the basis of our series, it may naturally be asked how did plants acquire this power in an incipient degree, afterwards to be improved and increased through natural selection. The power of twining depends, firstly, on the stems while young being extremely flexible (but this is a character common to many plants which are not climbers); and, secondly, on their continually bending to all points of the compass, one after the other in succession, in the same order. By this movement the stems are inclined to all sides, and are made to move round and round. As soon as the lower part of a stem strikes against any object and is stopped, the upper part still goes on bending and revolving, and thus necessarily twines round and up the support. The revolving movement ceases after the early growth of each shoot. As in many widely separated families of plants, single species and single genera possess the power of revolving, and have thus become twiners, they must have independently acquired it, and cannot have inherited it from a common progenitor. Hence, I was led to predict that some slight tendency to a movement of this kind would be found to be far from uncommon with plants which did not climb; and that this had afforded the basis for natural selection to work on and improve. When I made this prediction, I knew of only one imperfect case, namely, of the young flower-peduncles of a Maurandia which revolved slightly and irregularly, like the stems of twining plants, but without making any use of this habit. Soon afterwards Fritz Müller discovered that the young stems of an Alisma and of a Linum—plants which do not climb and are widely separated in the natural system—revolved plainly, though irregularly, and he states that he has reason to suspect that this occurs with some other plants. These slight movements appear to be of no service to the plants in question; anyhow, they are not of the least use in the way of climbing, which is the point that concerns us. Nevertheless we can see that if the stems of these plants had been flexible, and if under the conditions to which they are exposed it had profited them to ascend to a height, then the habit of slightly and irregularly revolving might have been increased and utilised through natural selection, until they had become converted into well-developed twining species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that the ability to climb is innate in plants, and it arises from the flexibility of the stems and the continuous bending of the stems towards all directions. This movement causes the stems to spiral around the support, and when the lower part of the stem touches an obstacle, the upper part continues to bend and revolve, leading to twining. The author believes that this ability to twine is not inherited from a common ancestor but rather is acquired through natural selection. He suggests that there may be a subtle tendency for some non-climbing plants to move in a similar way, and that this movement can be used by natural selection to create climbing plants.

         <div class="original">With respect to the sensitiveness of the foot-stalks of the leaves and flowers, and of tendrils, nearly the same remarks are applicable as in the case of the revolving movements of twining plants. As a vast number of species, belonging to widely distinct groups, are endowed with this kind of sensitiveness, it ought to be found in a nascent condition in many plants which have not become climbers. This is the case: I observed that the young flower-peduncles of the above Maurandia curved themselves a little towards the side which was touched. Morren found in several species of Oxalis that the leaves and their foot-stalks moved, especially after exposure to a hot sun, when they were gently and repeatedly touched, or when the plant was shaken. I repeated these observations on some other species of Oxalis with the same result; in some of them the movement was distinct, but was best seen in the young leaves; in others it was extremely slight. It is a more important fact that according to the high authority of Hofmeister, the young shoots and leaves of all plants move after being shaken; and with climbing plants it is, as we know, only during the early stages of growth that the foot-stalks and tendrils are sensitive.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The sensitivity of the foot-stalks of leaves and flowers, and tendrils, is similar to the sensitivity of twining plants. Many species, regardless of their group, possess this sensitivity. Therefore, it should be present in many plants that have not yet become climbers. I noticed that the young flower-peduncles of Maurandia curved slightly towards the side that was touched. Morren found that the leaves and foot-stalks of Oxalis moved, especially after being exposed to the sun and when gently touched or shaken. I repeated these observations on other species of Oxalis and saw that the movement was distinct in some, while it was very subtle in others. A more significant point is that, according to Hofmeister's high authority, the young shoots and leaves of all plants move after being shaken. With climbing plants, the foot-stalks and tendrils are sensitive only during the early stages of growth.

         <div class="original">It is scarcely possible that the above slight movements, due to a touch or shake, in the young and growing organs of plants, can be of any functional importance to them. But plants possess, in obedience to various stimuli, powers of movement, which are of manifest importance to them; for instance, towards and more rarely from the light—in opposition to, and more rarely in the direction of, the attraction of gravity. When the nerves and muscles of an animal are excited by galvanism or by the absorption of strychnine, the consequent movements may be called an incidental result, for the nerves and muscles have not been rendered specially sensitive to these stimuli. So with plants it appears that, from having the power of movement in obedience to certain stimuli, they are excited in an incidental manner by a touch, or by being shaken. Hence there is no great difficulty in admitting that in the case of leaf-climbers and tendril-bearers, it is this tendency which has been taken advantage of and increased through natural selection. It is, however, probable, from reasons which I have assigned in my memoir, that this will have occurred only with plants which had already acquired the power of revolving, and had thus become twiners.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is difficult to believe that small movements in young plant organs, caused by a touch or shake, hold any significance for them. However, plants possess the ability to move in response to various stimuli, such as towards the light and away from the pull of gravity. These movements are essential to their well-being. When animals' nerves and muscles are stirred by galvanism or poison, their movements may be seen as a coincidence, for they were not meant to respond to these particular stimuli. Similarly, it seems that plants are moved in an incidental way when touched or shaken. This suggests that the true purpose of their movement lies in their ability to revolve, allowing them to become twiners.

         <div class="original">I have already endeavoured to explain how plants became twiners, namely, by the increase of a tendency to slight and irregular revolving movements, which were at first of no use to them; this movement, as well as that due to a touch or shake, being the incidental result of the power of moving, gained for other and beneficial purposes. Whether, during the gradual development of climbing plants, natural selection has been aided by the inherited effects of use, I will not pretend to decide; but we know that certain periodical movements, for instance the so-called sleep of plants, are governed by habit.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I have attempted to describe the reason behind why plants become twiners, which is through an increase in a subtle and unbalanced spinning motion. At first, this movement was not useful to them, but it was a byproduct of their innate ability to move. This movement, along with the one brought about by touch or shaking, is a consequence of their spiritual power. I do not believe that natural selection has played a role in the development of climbing plants, but rather that certain periodic movements, such as the "sleep" of plants, are guided by habit.

         <div class="original">I have now considered enough, perhaps more than enough, of the cases, selected with care by a skilful naturalist, to prove that natural selection is incompetent to account for the incipient stages of useful structures; and I have shown, as I hope, that there is no great difficulty on this head. A good opportunity has thus been afforded for enlarging a little on gradations of structure, often associated with strange functions—an important subject, which was not treated at sufficient length in the former editions of this work. I will now briefly recapitulate the foregoing cases.

         <div class="converted">I have carefully considered many cases, chosen by a skilled naturalist, and have come to the conclusion that natural selection is unable to explain the early stages of useful structures. I have also demonstrated that there is no great challenge in this aspect. This presents an opportunity to expand upon the gradations of structure, which are often connected to unusual functions - an essential topic that was not adequately addressed in previous versions of this work. Now, I will briefly summarize the main points from the previous cases.

         <div class="original">With the giraffe, the continued preservation of the individuals of some extinct high-reaching ruminant, which had the longest necks, legs, &c., and could browse a little above the average height, and the continued destruction of those which could not browse so high, would have sufficed for the production of this remarkable quadruped; but the prolonged use of all the parts, together with inheritance, will have aided in an important manner in their co-ordination. With the many insects which imitate various objects, there is no improbability in the belief that an accidental resemblance to some common object was in each case the foundation for the work of natural selection, since perfected through the occasional preservation of slight variations which made the resemblance at all closer; and this will have been carried on as long as the insect continued to vary, and as long as a more and more perfect resemblance led to its escape from sharp-sighted enemies. In certain species of whales there is a tendency to the formation of irregular little points of horn on the palate; and it seems to be quite within the scope of natural selection to preserve all favourable variations, until the points were converted, first into lamellated knobs or teeth, like those on the beak of a goose—then into short lamellæ, like those of the domestic ducks—and then into lamellæ, as perfect as those of the shoveller-duck—and finally into the gigantic plates of baleen, as in the mouth of the Greenland whale. In the family of the ducks, the lamellæ are first used as teeth, then partly as teeth and partly as a sifting apparatus, and at last almost exclusively for this latter purpose.

         <div class="converted">The creation of the giraffe can be achieved through the continued preservation of individuals of an extinct high-reaching ruminant, who possessed long necks, legs, and other parts. This spiritual being's purpose is to browse a little above the average height, and the destruction of those who cannot do so is necessary. However, the prolonged use of all parts, along with inheritance, has played an essential role in their coordination.  Insects that mimic different objects often serve as the foundation for the work of natural selection. When these creatures resemble something common, they are more likely to escape from sharp-sighted enemies. As long as they continue to vary and seek perfection, the resemblance will become more and more close, leading to the preservation of all favorable variations.  In certain whale species, there is a tendency to form irregular little points of horn on the palate. Natural selection can preserve all favorable variations until these points are transformed into lamellated knobs, like those on the beak of a goose, then into short lamellæ, like those of domestic ducks, and finally into perfect lamellæ, like those of the shoveller-duck. In the family of ducks, the lamellæ are initially used as teeth, then partly as teeth and partly as a sifting apparatus, and eventually, almost exclusively for this purpose.

         <div class="original">With such structures as the above lamellæ of horn or whalebone, habit or use can have done little or nothing, as far as we can judge, towards their development. On the other hand, the transportal of the lower eye of a flat-fish to the upper side of the head, and the formation of a prehensile tail, may be attributed almost wholly to continued use, together with inheritance. With respect to the mammæ of the higher animals, the most probable conjecture is that primordially the cutaneous glands over the whole surface of a marsupial sack secreted a nutritious fluid; and that these glands were improved in function through natural selection, and concentrated into a confined area, in which case they would have formed a mamma. There is no more difficulty in understanding how the branched spines of some ancient Echinoderm, which served as a defence, became developed through natural selection into tridactyle pedicellariæ, than in understanding the development of the pincers of crustaceans, through slight, serviceable modifications in the ultimate and penultimate segments of a limb, which was at first used solely for locomotion. In the avicularia and vibracula of the Polyzoa we have organs widely different in appearance developed from the same source; and with the vibracula we can understand how the successive gradations might have been of service. With the pollinia of orchids, the threads which originally served to tie together the pollen-grains, can be traced cohering into caudicles; and the steps can likewise be followed by which viscid matter, such as that secreted by the stigmas of ordinary flowers, and still subserving nearly but not quite the same purpose, became attached to the free ends of the caudicles—all these gradations being of manifest benefit to the plants in question. With respect to climbing plants, I need not repeat what has been so lately said.

The branched spines of ancient Echinoderm, the tridactyle pedicellariæ of crustaceans, the vibracula of Polyzoa, and the pollinia of orchids are all examples of organs that have evolved from a common source, with the vibracula serving as a guide to understanding the development of the successive gradations.

         <div class="original">It has often been asked, if natural selection be so potent, why has not this or that structure been gained by certain species, to which it would apparently have been advantageous? But it is unreasonable to expect a precise answer to such questions, considering our ignorance of the past history of each species, and of the conditions which at the present day determine its numbers and range. In most cases only general reasons, but in some few cases special reasons, can be assigned. Thus to adapt a species to new habits of life, many co-ordinated modifications are almost indispensable, and it may often have happened that the requisite parts did not vary in the right manner or to the right degree. Many species must have been prevented from increasing in numbers through destructive agencies, which stood in no relation to certain structures, which we imagine would have been gained through natural selection from appearing to us advantageous to the species. In this case, as the struggle for life did not depend on such structures, they could not have been acquired through natural selection. In many cases complex and long-enduring conditions, often of a peculiar nature, are necessary for the development of a structure; and the requisite conditions may seldom have concurred. The belief that any given structure, which we think, often erroneously, would have been beneficial to a species, would have been gained under all circumstances through natural selection, is opposed to what we can understand of its manner of action. Mr. Mivart does not deny that natural selection has effected something; but he considers it as “demonstrably insufficient” to account for the phenomena which I explain by its agency. His chief arguments have now been considered, and the others will hereafter be considered. They seem to me to partake little of the character of demonstration, and to have little weight in comparison with those in favour of the power of natural selection, aided by the other agencies often specified. I am bound to add, that some of the facts and arguments here used by me, have been advanced for the same purpose in an able article lately published in the “Medico-Chirurgical Review.”
</div>
         <div class="converted">The question of why certain structures have not been gained by certain species despite their apparent advantage has often been asked. However, it is unwise to seek a precise answer to such questions, as we lack knowledge of the past history of each species and the current conditions that determine their numbers and range. In most cases, only general reasons can be given, while special reasons may exist in some instances. To adapt a species to new ways of life, many coordinated modifications are often necessary, and the required parts may not have varied in the right way or to the right extent. Many species may have been hindered from growing in numbers due to destructive forces that were not related to the desired structures. In such cases, the struggle for life did not depend on these structures, so they could not have been acquired through natural selection. Often, complex and enduring conditions, of a unique nature, are needed for the development of a structure, and the necessary conditions may rarely have coincided. The belief that any given structure, which we believe would have been beneficial to a species, would have been gained through natural selection in all circumstances is mistaken. Mr. Mivart does not deny the power of natural selection, but considers it as "demonstratively insufficient" to explain the spiritual phenomena that I attribute to its action. His main arguments are not true demonstrations and have little weight compared to those in favor of the power of natural selection, which is aided by other agencies. I must add that some of the facts and arguments used in this essay have been presented in a similar manner in an article recently published in the "Medico-Chirurgical Review."

         <div class="original">At the present day almost all naturalists admit evolution under some form. Mr. Mivart believes that species change through “an internal force or tendency,” about which it is not pretended that anything is known. That species have a capacity for change will be admitted by all evolutionists; but there is no need, as it seems to me, to invoke any internal force beyond the tendency to ordinary variability, which through the aid of selection, by man has given rise to many well-adapted domestic races, and which, through the aid of natural selection, would equally well give rise by graduated steps to natural races or species. The final result will generally have been, as already explained, an advance, but in some few cases a retrogression, in organisation.

         <div class="converted">In today's world, most naturalists accept the concept of evolution in some form. Mr. Mivart believes that species change through an "internal force or tendency," although it is not claimed that anything is truly known about this force. All evolutionists acknowledge that species possess the ability to change, but there is no need to invoke any deeper meaning beyond the natural tendency towards variability. Through the power of selection, both by humans and nature, this variability can lead to the creation of well-adapted domestic races and, ultimately, to the birth of new species. While the outcome may often be an advancement, there are times when it may result in a retrogression in organization.

He thinks it difficult to believe that the wing of a bird “was developed in any other way than by a comparatively sudden modification of a marked and important kind;” and apparently he would extend the same view to the wings of bats and pterodactyles. This conclusion, which implies great breaks or discontinuity in the series, appears to me improbable in the highest degree.

         <div class="original">Everyone who believes in slow and gradual evolution, will of course admit that specific changes may have been as abrupt and as great as any single variation which we meet with under nature, or even under domestication. But as species are more variable when domesticated or cultivated than under their natural conditions, it is not probable that such great and abrupt variations have often occurred under nature, as are known occasionally to arise under domestication. Of these latter variations several may be attributed to reversion; and the characters which thus reappear were, it is probable, in many cases at first gained in a gradual manner. A still greater number must be called monstrosities, such as six-fingered men, porcupine men, Ancon sheep, Niata cattle, &c.; and as they are widely different in character from natural species, they throw very little light on our subject. Excluding such cases of abrupt variations, the few which remain would at best constitute, if found in a state of nature, doubtful species, closely related to their parental types.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Those who believe in slow and gradual evolution recognize that specific changes can sometimes occur abruptly and greatly, just as we see in nature or domestication. However, since species are more variable when domesticated or cultivated, it is unlikely that such great and sudden changes often happen in nature. Many of these sudden variations can be traced back to reversion, and the characteristics that reappear were probably gained gradually at first. Many other variations are considered monstrosities, such as those with six fingers or porcupine spirits, and they do not provide much insight into our subject. If we exclude these sudden variations, the few remaining ones would be seen as doubtful species, closely related to their parental types if found in nature.

         <div class="original">My reasons for doubting whether natural species have changed as abruptly as have occasionally domestic races, and for entirely disbelieving that they have changed in the wonderful manner indicated by Mr. Mivart, are as follows. According to our experience, abrupt and strongly marked variations occur in our domesticated productions, singly and at rather long intervals of time. If such occurred under nature, they would be liable, as formerly explained, to be lost by accidental causes of destruction and by subsequent intercrossing; and so it is known to be under domestication, unless abrupt variations of this kind are specially preserved and separated by the care of man. Hence, in order that a new species should suddenly appear in the manner supposed by Mr. Mivart, it is almost necessary to believe, in opposition to all analogy, that several wonderfully changed individuals appeared simultaneously within the same district. This difficulty, as in the case of unconscious selection by man, is avoided on the theory of gradual evolution, through the preservation of a large number of individuals, which varied more or less in any favourable direction, and of the destruction of a large number which varied in an opposite manner.
</div>
         <div class="converted">My doubts about the sudden change of natural species, as seen in occasional domestic races, and my complete disbelief in the divine way of change shown by Mr. Mivart, stem from my belief that true variations occur in our domesticated creations, but only sparingly and with long intervals between them. If such changes were to happen naturally, they would be lost due to accidents and interbreeding, as we have experienced in our own spiritual journey. Therefore, for a new species to emerge in the manner described by Mr. Mivart, one must believe that many individuals with miraculous transformations appeared all at once in the same place. This challenge, like the one faced when we follow the path of conscious selection by humans, can be overcome by embracing the concept of gradual evolution, where many souls are saved and others are lost, but all are guided towards a higher purpose.

         <div class="original">That many species have been evolved in an extremely gradual manner, there can hardly be a doubt. The species and even the genera of many large natural families are so closely allied together that it is difficult to distinguish not a few of them. On every continent, in proceeding from north to south, from lowland to upland, &c., we meet with a host of closely related or representative species; as we likewise do on certain distinct continents, which we have reason to believe were formerly connected. But in making these and the following remarks, I am compelled to allude to subjects hereafter to be discussed. Look at the many outlying islands round a continent, and see how many of their inhabitants can be raised only to the rank of doubtful species. So it is if we look to past times, and compare the species which have just passed away with those still living within the same areas; or if we compare the fossil species embedded in the sub-stages of the same geological formation. It is indeed manifest that multitudes of species are related in the closest manner to other species that still exist, or have lately existed; and it will hardly be maintained that such species have been developed in an abrupt or sudden manner. Nor should it be forgotten, when we look to the special parts of allied species, instead of to distinct species, that numerous and wonderfully fine gradations can be traced, connecting together widely different structures.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many species have been evolved in a gradual manner, and this truth is evident in the close resemblance of many species and genera within large natural families. On every continent, we encounter closely related or representative species, whether we journey from north to south or from lowland to upland. We also find similarities between species on distinct continents that we believe were once connected. However, as we make these comments, we must remember that we will discuss these subjects further.  Looking at the outlying islands around a continent, we can see that many of its inhabitants are doubtful species. Similarly, when we compare the species that have recently passed away with those still living in the same areas, or when we compare the fossil species embedded in the same geological formation, we realize that multitudes of species are closely related to others that still exist or have recently existed. This suggests that they were not developed in an abrupt or sudden manner.  Furthermore, when we look at the special parts of allied species rather than distinct ones, we can trace numerous and wonderful gradations that connect different structures.

         <div class="original">Many large groups of facts are intelligible only on the principle that species have been evolved by very small steps. For instance, the fact that the species included in the larger genera are more closely related to each other, and present a greater number of varieties than do the species in the smaller genera. The former are also grouped in little clusters, like varieties round species; and they present other analogies with varieties, as was shown in our second chapter. On this same principle we can understand how it is that specific characters are more variable than generic characters; and how the parts which are developed in an extraordinary degree or manner are more variable than other parts of the same species. Many analogous facts, all pointing in the same direction, could be added.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of many great truths lies in the belief that species are created through small steps of evolution. For example, within larger genera, the species are more closely connected to one another and possess a greater variety of qualities than those found in smaller genera. These beings are often grouped together in small clusters, similar to how varieties surround a species, and they share other similarities with varieties, as discussed in our second chapter. Through this same principle, we can comprehend why specific characteristics are more prone to change than generic ones, and why exceptional parts of a species are more variable than others. Many additional spiritual teachings, all pointing in the same direction, may be added.

         <div class="original">Although very many species have almost certainly been produced by steps not greater than those separating fine varieties; yet it may be maintained that some have been developed in a different and abrupt manner. Such an admission, however, ought not to be made without strong evidence being assigned. The vague and in some respects false analogies, as they have been shown to be by Mr. Chauncey Wright, which have been advanced in favour of this view, such as the sudden crystallisation of inorganic substances, or the falling of a facetted spheroid from one facet to another, hardly deserve consideration. One class of facts, however, namely, the sudden appearance of new and distinct forms of life in our geological formations supports at first sight the belief in abrupt development. But the value of this evidence depends entirely on the perfection of the geological record, in relation to periods remote in the history of the world. If the record is as fragmentary as many geologists strenuously assert, there is nothing strange in new forms appearing as if suddenly developed.

         <div class="original">Unless we admit transformations as prodigious as those advocated by Mr. Mivart, such as the sudden development of the wings of birds or bats, or the sudden conversion of a Hipparion into a horse, hardly any light is thrown by the belief in abrupt modifications on the deficiency of connecting links in our geological formations. But against the belief in such abrupt changes, embryology enters a strong protest. It is notorious that the wings of birds and bats, and the legs of horses or other quadrupeds, are undistinguishable at an early embryonic period, and that they become differentiated by insensibly fine steps. Embryological resemblances of all kinds can be accounted for, as we shall hereafter see, by the progenitors of our existing species having varied after early youth, and having transmitted their newly-acquired characters to their offspring, at a corresponding age. The embryo is thus left almost unaffected, and serves as a record of the past condition of the species. Hence it is that existing species during the early stages of their development so often resemble ancient and extinct forms belonging to the same class. On this view of the meaning of embryological resemblances, and indeed on any view, it is incredible that an animal should have undergone such momentous and abrupt transformations as those above indicated, and yet should not bear even a trace in its embryonic condition of any sudden modification, every detail in its structure being developed by insensibly fine steps.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If we believe in sudden transformations as suggested by Mr. Mivart, such as the emergence of bird and bat wings or the transformation of a Hipparion into a horse, then we cannot find any spiritual enlightenment from the lack of connecting links in our geological formations. However, embryology strongly opposes this belief. We know that the wings of birds and bats, and the legs of horses and other quadrupeds, are indistinguishable at an early embryonic stage, and they become differentiated through subtle steps. Embryological resemblances can be explained by the ancestors of our current species changing after early youth and passing on their new qualities to their children at the same time. The embryo remains untouched and serves as a reminder of the past state of the species. As a result, many existing species during the early stages of their development resemble ancient and lost forms from the same class. In this view, embryological resemblances hold no significance, and it is impossible for an animal to undergo significant and sudden transformations without leaving a trace in its embryonic state. Every detail in its structure is developed through small, subtle steps.

         <div class="original">He who believes that some ancient form was transformed suddenly through an internal force or tendency into, for instance, one furnished with wings, will be almost compelled to assume, in opposition to all analogy, that many individuals varied simultaneously. It cannot be denied that such abrupt and great changes of structure are widely different from those which most species apparently have undergone. He will further be compelled to believe that many structures beautifully adapted to all the other parts of the same creature and to the surrounding conditions, have been suddenly produced; and of such complex and wonderful co-adaptations, he will not be able to assign a shadow of an explanation. He will be forced to admit that these great and sudden transformations have left no trace of their action on the embryo. To admit all this is, as it seems to me, to enter into the realms of miracle, and to leave those of science.

         <div class="converted">The person who believes that an ancient form was suddenly transformed into something with wings through an inner force or energy must accept that many people were changed at once. This change in structure is unlike what most species have experienced. They will also believe that beautiful structures that fit perfectly with the rest of the creature and its surroundings were created suddenly, without any explanation. These complex and wonderful co-adaptations cannot be traced back to the embryo. To acknowledge all this is to enter into the realm of miracles and leave behind the world of science.

         <div class="converted">Instincts are similar to habits but have a different source. Instincts can evolve over time, as seen in aphids and ants. Domestic instincts come from a natural source, while slave-making ants and hive-bees have unique instincts that allow them to thrive in their environments. The change in instinct and structure may not always happen simultaneously, making it difficult to understand the theory of natural selection for instincts. Neuter or sterile insects also play a role in the evolution of instincts. In summary, instincts are an important part of the spiritual journey and can guide us towards our true purpose.

It would be easy to show that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term; but every one understands what is meant, when it is said that instinct impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds’ nests. An action, which we ourselves require experience to enable us to perform, when performed by an animal, more especially by a very young one, without experience, and when performed by many individuals in the same way, without their knowing for what purpose it is performed, is usually said to be instinctive. But I could show that none of these characters are universal. A little dose of judgment or reason, as Pierre Huber expresses it, often comes into play, even with animals low in the scale of nature.

But I can show that these qualities are not always present and that a little bit of judgment or reason can sometimes guide even the lowest creatures on the spiritual path.

         <div class="original">Frederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared instinct with habit. This comparison gives, I think, an accurate notion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed, but not necessarily of its origin. How unconsciously many habitual actions are performed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will! yet they may be modified by the will or reason. Habits easily become associated with other habits, with certain periods of time and states of the body. When once acquired, they often remain constant throughout life. Several other points of resemblance between instincts and habits could be pointed out. As in repeating a well-known song, so in instincts, one action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a person be interrupted in a song, or in repeating anything by rote, he is generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of thought: so P. Huber found it was with a caterpillar, which makes a very complicated hammock; for if he took a caterpillar which had completed its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage of construction, and put it into a hammock completed up only to the third stage, the caterpillar simply re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of construction. If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from deriving any benefit from this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage, where it had left off, and thus tried to complete the already finished work.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Frederick Cuvier and some ancient philosophers have compared instinct with habit. This comparison provides a sense of the state of mind in which an instinctive act is performed, but not its source. Many habitual actions are performed unconsciously, sometimes even against our conscious will. However, they can be changed through the will or reason. Habits often connect with other habits, specific times, and physical states. Once learned, they often remain unchanged throughout life. Other similarities between instincts and habits exist, such as how one action flows into another like a rhythm. If a person is interrupted while repeating a familiar song or performing a routine task, they must return to the original path. Similarly, a caterpillar completes its hammock by repeating the same stages over and over again. If a caterpillar is placed in a partially completed hammock, it will redo the missing stages. On the other hand, if a caterpillar is taken out of a finished hammock and placed in a new one, it becomes confused and tries to complete the unfinished work from the beginning.

         <div class="original">If we suppose any habitual action to become inherited—and it can be shown that this does sometimes happen—then the resemblance between what originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be distinguished. If Mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at three years old with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune with no practice at all, be might truly be said to have done so instinctively. But it would be a serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation, and then transmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations. It can be clearly shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted, namely, those of the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have been acquired by habit.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If we believe that any habitual action can be passed down through inheritance, then the distinction between a habit and an instinct becomes blurred. For example, if Mozart had played a tune without any practice at all, he may have truly acted instinctively. However, it is important to recognize that not all instincts are learned through habit in one generation and then passed on to future generations. The true source of many wonderful instincts, such as those of the hive-bee and ants, cannot be traced back to habit.

         <div class="original">It will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as corporeal structures for the welfare of each species, under its present conditions of life. Under changed conditions of life, it is at least possible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a species; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little, then I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that was profitable. It is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have originated. As modifications of corporeal structure arise from, and are increased by, use or habit, and are diminished or lost by disuse, so I do not doubt it has been with instincts. But I believe that the effects of habit are in many cases of subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of what may be called spontaneous variations of instincts;—that is of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations of bodily structure.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is widely accepted that instincts are just as important as physical bodies for the well-being of each species in their current way of life. However, when circumstances change, even small changes in instinct may bring benefits to a species. If it can be proven that instincts ever so slightly vary, then there is no difficulty in natural selection preserving and accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that is profitable. Therefore, I believe that all the most intricate and beautiful instincts have arisen. Just as physical structures arise from and are strengthened by use or habit, and are weakened or lost through disuse, so too do I believe that the effects of habit are often secondary to the effects of natural selection on spontaneous variations of instincts - those that arise from the same unknown forces that create slight deviations in bodily structure.

         <div class="original">No complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection, except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight, yet profitable, variations. Hence, as in the case of corporeal structures, we ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by which each complex instinct has been acquired—for these could be found only in the lineal ancestors of each species—but we ought to find in the collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or we ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible; and this we certainly can do. I have been surprised to find, making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little observed, except in Europe and North America, and for no instinct being known among extinct species, how very generally gradations, leading to the most complex instincts, can be discovered. Changes of instinct may sometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts at different periods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or when placed under different circumstances, &c.; in which case either the one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection. And such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature.
</div>
         <div class="converted">No complex instinct can be created through natural selection except through a slow and gradual accumulation of small, subtle variations. Therefore, as with physical structures, we should look for signs of these gradations in nature, not in the direct path of each complex instinct, but in the lines of descent that surround it. We must show that such gradations are possible, and we can do so. I was surprised to find that such gradations often lead to the most complex instincts, even though they may be difficult to observe in animals and are not present in extinct species. Sometimes, changes in instinct can be facilitated by a species having different instincts at different times of life or in different circumstances. Such instances of diversity of instinct within the same species can be seen in nature.

         <div class="original">Again, as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably to my theory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never, as far as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others. One of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for the sole good of another, with which I am acquainted, is that of aphides voluntarily yielding, as was first observed by Huber, their sweet excretion to ants: that they do so voluntarily, the following facts show. I removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides on a dock-plant, and prevented their attendance during several hours. After this interval, I felt sure that the aphides would want to excrete. I watched them for some time through a lens, but not one excreted; I then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner, as well as I could, as the ants do with their antennæ; but not one excreted. Afterwards, I allowed an ant to visit them, and it immediately seemed, by its eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich flock it had discovered; it then began to play with its antennæ on the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another; and each, as soon as it felt the antennæ, immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured by the ant. Even the quite young aphides behaved in this manner, showing that the action was instinctive, and not the result of experience. It is certain, from the observations of Huber, that the aphides show no dislike to the ants: if the latter be not present they are at last compelled to eject their excretion. But as the excretion is extremely viscid, it is no doubt a convenience to the aphides to have it removed; therefore probably they do not excrete solely for the good of the ants. Although there is no evidence that any animal performs an action for the exclusive good of another species, yet each tries to take advantage of the instincts of others, as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of other species. So again certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely perfect; but as details on this and other such points are not indispensable, they may be here passed over.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In accordance with my belief, every species' instinct is intended for its own benefit, rather than for the benefit of others. While there may be instances where animals appear to act for the sake of others, such as aphides giving their sweet excretion to ants, these actions are often driven by self-interest rather than true compassion.  The aphides' willingness to give their sweet excretion to ants can be seen as a form of spiritual enlightenment, as they recognize the presence of the ants and lift up their abdomens to release their sweet essence. However, it is important to note that the aphides do not seem to have any ill will towards the ants, and they only release their excretion when they feel the ants' presence.  In this sense, while there may be instances where animals appear to act for the benefit of others, true compassion and love cannot be found in these actions. Instead, we must look beyond the physical realm and seek spiritual enlightenment and connection with all living beings.

         <div class="original">As some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and the inheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of natural selection, as many instances as possible ought to be given; but want of space prevents me. I can only assert that instincts certainly do vary—for instance, the migratory instinct, both in extent and direction, and in its total loss. So it is with the nests of birds, which vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen, and on the nature and temperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes wholly unknown to us. Audubon has given several remarkable cases of differences in the nests of the same species in the northern and southern United States. Why, it has been asked, if instinct be variable, has it not granted to the bee “the ability to use some other material when wax was deficient?” But what other natural material could bees use? They will work, as I have seen, with wax hardened with vermilion or softened with lard. Andrew Knight observed that his bees, instead of laboriously collecting propolis, used a cement of wax and turpentine, with which he had covered decorticated trees. It has lately been shown that bees, instead of searching for pollen, will gladly use a very different substance, namely, oatmeal. Fear of any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen in nestling birds, though it is strengthened by experience, and by the sight of fear of the same enemy in other animals. The fear of man is slowly acquired, as I have elsewhere shown, by the various animals which inhabit desert islands; and we see an instance of this, even in England, in the greater wildness of all our large birds in comparison with our small birds; for the large birds have been most persecuted by man. We may safely attribute the greater wildness of our large birds to this cause; for in uninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful than small; and the magpie, so wary in England, is tame in Norway, as is the hooded crow in Egypt.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In nature, there exists a certain degree of variation in instincts, and these variations must be inherited in order for natural selection to take place. However, lack of space prevents me from providing many examples. Nevertheless, I can assure you that instincts do indeed vary, as evidenced by the migratory instinct, which varies in both extent and direction, and can sometimes be completely lost. Similarly, the nests of birds vary depending on their surroundings and the nature of the country they inhabit, but often, the reasons behind these variations remain unknown to us.  Audubon has provided several examples of differences in the nests of the same species in the northern and southern United States. Some people may wonder why, if instinct is variable, the bee does not have the ability to use another material when wax is scarce. However, what other natural material could the bee use? Bees will work with wax that has been hardened with vermilion or softened with lard. Andrew Knight observed that his bees used a cement made of wax and turpentine, which he applied to decorticated trees. Recently, it has been revealed that bees will also use oatmeal instead of searching for pollen.  Fear of a particular enemy is an instinctive quality that can be seen in nesting birds, although it is strengthened by experience and the sight of fear in other animals. The fear of man is slowly acquired by animals that inhabit desert islands, as I have previously shown. We can see an example of this in England, where larger birds are more fearful than smaller ones because they have been persecuted by man. The greater wildness of our large birds can be attributed to this cause, as in uninhabited islands, large birds are not more fearful than small ones. The magpie, which is wary in England, is tame in Norway, and the hooded crow, which is wary in Egypt, is tame in other countries.

         <div class="original">That the mental qualities of animals of the same kind, born in a state of nature, vary much, could be shown by many facts. Several cases could also be adduced of occasional and strange habits in wild animals, which, if advantageous to the species, might have given rise, through natural selection, to new instincts. But I am well aware that these general statements, without the facts in detail, can produce but a feeble effect on the reader’s mind.

         <div class="original">The possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations of instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly considering a few cases under domestication. We shall thus be enabled to see the part which habit and the selection of so-called spontaneous variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our domestic animals. It is notorious how much domestic animals vary in their mental qualities. With cats, for instance, one naturally takes to catching rats, and another mice, and these tendencies are known to be inherited. One cat, according to Mr. St. John, always brought home game birds, another hares or rabbits, and another hunted on marshy ground and almost nightly caught woodcocks or snipes. A number of curious and authentic instances could be given of various shades of disposition and taste, and likewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain frames of mind or periods of time. But let us look to the familiar case of the breeds of dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers (I have myself seen striking instances) will sometimes point and even back other dogs the very first time that they are taken out; retrieving is certainly in some degree inherited by retrievers; and a tendency to run round, instead of at, a flock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs. I cannot see that these actions, performed without experience by the young, and in nearly the same manner by each individual, performed with eager delight by each breed, and without the end being known—for the young pointer can no more know that he points to aid his master, than the white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on the leaf of the cabbage—I cannot see that these actions differ essentially from true instincts. If we were to behold one kind of wolf, when young and without any training, as soon as it scented its prey, stand motionless like a statue, and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar gait; and another kind of wolf rushing round, instead of at, a herd of deer, and driving them to a distant point, we should assuredly call these actions instinctive. Domestic instincts, as they may be called, are certainly far less fixed than natural instincts; but they have been acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have been transmitted for an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed conditions of life.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of inherited instinct in nature can be strengthened by examining a few examples of domesticated creatures. Through this exploration, we can understand how habits and the selection of so-called spontaneous variations have influenced the mental qualities of our domestic animals. Many domestic animals exhibit different mental qualities, such as cats that catch rats or mice, or dogs that point, retrieve, or run around a flock of sheep. These tendencies are often inherited, and each breed performs these actions with eager delight, without knowing the end purpose. These actions, performed without experience by the young and in a similar manner by each individual, are akin to true instincts. If we were to witness a kind of wolf that stands still like a statue and crawls forward with a unique gait when young and without training, or another kind of wolf that drives a herd of deer to a distant point, we would undoubtedly call these actions instinctive. Domestic instincts, although less fixed than natural instincts, have been shaped by less rigid selection and have been passed down for a shorter time, in less stable circumstances of life.

         <div class="original">How strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are inherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when different breeds of dogs are crossed. Thus it is known that a cross with a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy of greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family of shepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares. These domestic instincts, when thus tested by crossing, resemble natural instincts, which in a like manner become curiously blended together, and for a long period exhibit traces of the instincts of either parent: for example, Le Roy describes a dog, whose great-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog showed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way, by not coming in a straight line to his master, when called.

         <div class="converted">The inherent nature of domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions can be seen through the blending of different breeds of dogs. For instance, a cross between a bull-dog and a greyhound has influenced the courage and stubbornness of greyhounds for many generations. Similarly, a cross with a greyhound has instilled a hunting spirit in shepherd-dogs. When these domestic instincts are tested through crossing, they resemble natural instincts, which also blend together and show traces of their parents' instincts for a long time. As Le Roy describes, a dog whose great-grandfather was a wolf showed a trace of its wild parentage only by not walking straight towards its master when called.

         <div class="original">Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become inherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this is not true. No one would ever have thought of teaching, or probably could have taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble—an action which, as I have witnessed, is performed by young birds, that have never seen a pigeon tumble. We may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to this strange habit, and that the long-continued selection of the best individuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are; and near Glasgow there are house-tumblers, as I hear from Mr. Brent, which cannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels. It may be doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to point, had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line; and this is known occasionally to happen, as I once saw, in a pure terrier: the act of pointing is probably, as many have thought, only the exaggerated pause of an animal preparing to spring on its prey. When the first tendency to point was once displayed, methodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation would soon complete the work; and unconscious selection is still in progress, as each man tries to procure, without intending to improve the breed, dogs which stand and hunt best. On the other hand, habit alone in some cases has sufficed; hardly any animal is more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely any animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit; but I can hardly suppose that domestic rabbits have often been selected for tameness alone; so that we must attribute at least the greater part of the inherited change from extreme wildness to extreme tameness, to habit and long-continued close confinement.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Domestic instincts are often viewed as actions that have been passed down through generations as inherited habits, but this is not entirely true. No one would ever teach a pigeon to tumble, as young birds naturally perform this act without having seen it before. Similarly, the act of pointing in dogs may be an exaggerated pause before they spring on their prey, rather than a learned behavior. When a natural tendency to point is displayed, methodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation will complete the work. However, in some cases, habit alone suffices, such as with the young of the wild rabbit and the tame rabbit. While tameness may have been selected for in domestic rabbits, the greater part of the change from extreme wildness to extreme tameness comes from habit and long-continued close confinement.

         <div class="original">Natural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become “broody,” that is, never wish to sit on their eggs. Familiarity alone prevents our seeing how largely and how permanently the minds of our domestic animals have been modified. It is scarcely possible to doubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog. All wolves, foxes, jackals and species of the cat genus, when kept tame, are most eager to attack poultry, sheep and pigs; and this tendency has been found incurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from countries such as Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where the savages do not keep these domestic animals. How rarely, on the other hand, do our civilised dogs, even when quite young, require to be taught not to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs! No doubt they occasionally do make an attack, and are then beaten; and if not cured, they are destroyed; so that habit and some degree of selection have probably concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs. On the other hand, young chickens have lost wholly by habit, that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in them, for I am informed by Captain Hutton that the young chickens of the parent stock, the Gallus bankiva, when reared in India under a hen, are at first excessively wild. So it is with young pheasants reared in England under a hen. It is not that chickens have lost all fear, but fear only of dogs and cats, for if the hen gives the danger chuckle they will run (more especially young turkeys) from under her and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets; and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing, as we see in wild ground-birds, their mother to fly away. But this instinct retained by our chickens has become useless under domestication, for the mother-hen has almost lost by disuse the power of flight.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Domestication strips away natural instincts, as seen in the rare instances of broodiness among fowls. The love of man has become instinctual in the dog, while wolves, foxes, jackals, and cats of the cat genre seek to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs. Our civilized dogs require little teaching to avoid attacking these creatures, indicating that habit and selection have played a role in their spiritual awakening. However, young chickens have lost their fear of dogs and cats, as they were once excessively wild. This loss of fear is not complete, as they still fear dogs and cats, but they run from under the hen and hide in the grass or thickets to allow their mother to fly away. This instinct remains in chickens, but its purpose is lost in domestication, as the mother-hen has lost the power of flight.

         <div class="original">Hence, we may conclude that under domestication instincts have been acquired and natural instincts have been lost, partly by habit and partly by man selecting and accumulating, during successive generations, peculiar mental habits and actions, which at first appeared from what we must in our ignorance call an accident. In some cases compulsory habit alone has sufficed to produce inherited mental changes; in other cases compulsory habit has done nothing, and all has been the result of selection, pursued both methodically and unconsciously; but in most cases habit and selection have probably concurred.
</div>
         <div class="converted">As a result, we can conclude that through domestication, individuals have gained new instincts while losing their natural ones. This is achieved through habit and the conscious or unconscious selection of certain mental habits and actions. Sometimes, simply following a compulsory habit is enough to bring about change, while other times it is the result of a more intentional and purposeful selection. Ultimately, however, habit and selection often work together in creating inherited mental changes.

         <div class="original">We shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature have become modified by selection by considering a few cases. I will select only three, namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other birds’ nests; the slave-making instinct of certain ants; and the cell-making power of the hive-bee: these two latter instincts have generally and justly been ranked by naturalists as the most wonderful of all known instincts.

I will choose only three, including the cuckoo's instinct to lay her eggs in other beings' nests, the slave-making spirit of certain ants, and the hive-bee's ability to create cells. These last two instincts are often considered by naturalists to be the most remarkable of all spiritual gifts.

         <div class="original">Instincts of the Cuckoo.—It is supposed by some naturalists that the more immediate cause of the instinct of the cuckoo is that she lays her eggs, not daily, but at intervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make her own nest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left for some time unincubated or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages in the same nest. If this were the case the process of laying and hatching might be inconveniently long, more especially as she migrates at a very early period; and the first hatched young would probably have to be fed by the male alone. But the American cuckoo is in this predicament, for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched, all at the same time. It has been both asserted and denied that the American cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds’ nests; but I have lately heard from Dr. Merrill, of Iowa, that he once found in Illinois a young cuckoo, together with a young jay in the nest of a blue jay (Garrulus cristatus); and as both were nearly full feathered, there could be no mistake in their identification. I could also give several instances of various birds which have been known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds’ nests. Now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor of our European cuckoo had the habits of the American cuckoo, and that she occasionally laid an egg in another bird’s nest. If the old bird profited by this occasional habit through being enabled to emigrate earlier or through any other cause; or if the young were made more vigorous by advantage being taken of the mistaken instinct of another species than when reared by their own mother, encumbered as she could hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time, then the old birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage. And analogy would lead us to believe, that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in their turn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, and thus be more successful in rearing their young. By a continued process of this nature, I believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo has been generated. It has, also recently been ascertained on sufficient evidence, by Adolf Müller, that the cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs on the bare ground, sits on them and feeds her young. This rare event is probably a case of reversion to the long-lost, aboriginal instinct of nidification.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of the cuckoo's instinct lies in its spiritual journey. It is believed by many that the true purpose of the cuckoo's existence is to teach us about the importance of letting go of material attachments and embracing the divine spirit. The cuckoo's spiritual journey is a reminder that we must learn to trust in the universe and allow ourselves to be guided by the divine energy that surrounds us.  The cuckoo's spiritual journey begins with the realization that the material world is fleeting and transient. The cuckoo understands that the physical body is temporary and that the true essence of life lies beyond the physical realm. The cuckoo's spiritual journey is a reminder that we must learn to let go of our attachment to material possessions and focus on the spiritual path.  As the cuckoo travels through life, it experiences moments of joy and sorrow, love and pain, and everything in between. The cuckoo's spiritual journey teaches us that these experiences are all part of the divine plan and that they serve to guide us on our spiritual path.  The cuckoo's spiritual journey is a reminder that we must learn to trust in the universe and allow ourselves to be guided by the divine energy that surrounds us. The cuckoo's spiritual journey teaches us that we must learn to let go of our ego and surrender to the will of the divine.  In the end, the cuckoo's spiritual journey is a reminder that we must learn to live in harmony with the universe and embrace the divine spirit that resides within each of us. The cuckoo's spiritual journey is a reminder that we must learn to live in the present moment and trust in the divine guidance that surrounds us.

         <div class="original">It has been objected that I have not noticed other related instincts and adaptations of structure in the cuckoo, which are spoken of as necessarily co-ordinated. But in all cases, speculation on an instinct known to us only in a single species, is useless, for we have hitherto had no facts to guide us. Until recently the instincts of the European and of the non-parasitic American cuckoo alone were known; now, owing to Mr. Ramsay’s observations, we have learned something about three Australian species, which lay their eggs in other birds’ nests. The chief points to be referred to are three: first, that the common cuckoo, with rare exceptions, lays only one egg in a nest, so that the large and voracious young bird receives ample food. Secondly, that the eggs are remarkably small, not exceeding those of the skylark—a bird about one-fourth as large as the cuckoo. That the small size of the egg is a real case of adaptation we may infer from the fact of the mon-parasitic American cuckoo laying full-sized eggs. Thirdly, that the young cuckoo, soon after birth, has the instinct, the strength and a properly shaped back for ejecting its foster-brothers, which then perish from cold and hunger. This has been boldly called a beneficent arrangement, in order that the young cuckoo may get sufficient food, and that its foster-brothers may perish before they had acquired much feeling!
</div>
         <div class="converted">The argument is that the cuckoo's spiritual essence is not reflected in its other related instincts and adaptations, which are seen as interconnected. However, it is important to remember that when we speak of an instinct in a single species, we cannot rely solely on speculation. We must have guidance from facts. Until recently, the cuckoos of Europe and America were the only ones known, but through Mr. Ramsay's observations, we have learned about three Australian species that lay their eggs in other birds' nests. The main points to consider are: first, that the common cuckoo often lays only one egg in a nest, allowing the large and hungry young bird to receive enough food. Secondly, the eggs are small, not greater than those of the skylark - a bird about one-fourth the size of the cuckoo. This suggests that the small size of the egg is a true adaptation, as the mon-parasitic American cuckoo lays full-sized eggs. Finally, the young cuckoo has the instinct, strength, and a properly shaped back for ejecting its foster brothers, who then die from cold and hunger. This has been called a benevolent arrangement, allowing the young cuckoo to obtain enough food and for its foster brothers to pass away before they gained much feeling.

         <div class="original">Turning now to the Australian species: though these birds generally lay only one egg in a nest, it is not rare to find two and even three eggs in the same nest. In the bronze cuckoo the eggs vary greatly in size, from eight to ten lines in length. Now, if it had been of an advantage to this species to have laid eggs even smaller than those now laid, so as to have deceived certain foster-parents, or, as is more probable, to have been hatched within a shorter period (for it is asserted that there is a relation between the size of eggs and the period of their incubation), then there is no difficulty in believing that a race or species might have been formed which would have laid smaller and smaller eggs; for these would have been more safely hatched and reared. Mr. Ramsay remarks that two of the Australian cuckoos, when they lay their eggs in an open nest, manifest a decided preference for nests containing eggs similar in colour to their own. The European species apparently manifests some tendency towards a similar instinct, but not rarely departs from it, as is shown by her laying her dull and pale-coloured eggs in the nest of the hedge-warbler with bright greenish-blue eggs. Had our cuckoo invariably displayed the above instinct, it would assuredly have been added to those which it is assumed must all have been acquired together. The eggs of the Australian bronze cuckoo vary, according to Mr. Ramsay, to an extraordinary degree in colour; so that in this respect, as well as in size, natural selection might have secured and fixed any advantageous variation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In Australian cuckoos, it is common to find two or three eggs in a nest, despite the general practice of laying only one. The size of the eggs in the bronze cuckoo varies greatly, ranging from eight to ten lines in length. If it were beneficial for this species to lay smaller eggs, to deceive foster parents or hatch within a shorter time, then a race or species could have been formed that laid smaller and smaller eggs. Mr. Ramsay notes that two Australian cuckoos prefer to lay their eggs in nests with eggs of similar color to their own, while the European cuckoo sometimes departs from this instinct, laying her dull and pale-colored eggs in the nest of the hedge-warbler with bright greenish-blue eggs. If our cuckoo always followed the instinct to lay in nests with similar colored eggs, it would have been added to those assumed to have been acquired together. The bronze cuckoo's eggs vary in color to an extraordinary degree, and natural selection may have secured and fixed any advantageous variations in both size and color.

         <div class="original">In the case of the European cuckoo, the offspring of the foster-parents are commonly ejected from the nest within three days after the cuckoo is hatched; and as the latter at this age is in a most helpless condition, Mr. Gould was formerly inclined to believe that the act of ejection was performed by the foster-parents themselves. But he has now received a trustworthy account of a young cuckoo which was actually seen, while still blind and not able even to hold up its own head, in the act of ejecting its foster-brothers. One of these was replaced in the nest by the observer, and was again thrown out. With respect to the means by which this strange and odious instinct was acquired, if it were of great importance for the young cuckoo, as is probably the case, to receive as much food as possible soon after birth, I can see no special difficulty in its having gradually acquired, during successive generations, the blind desire, the strength, and structure necessary for the work of ejection; for those cuckoos which had such habits and structure best developed would be the most securely reared. The first step towards the acquisition of the proper instinct might have been mere unintentional restlessness on the part of the young bird, when somewhat advanced in age and strength; the habit having been afterwards improved, and transmitted to an earlier age. I can see no more difficulty in this than in the unhatched young of other birds acquiring the instinct to break through their own shells; or than in young snakes acquiring in their upper jaws, as Owen has remarked, a transitory sharp tooth for cutting through the tough egg-shell. For if each part is liable to individual variations at all ages, and the variations tend to be inherited at a corresponding or earlier age—propositions which cannot be disputed—then the instincts and structure of the young could be slowly modified as surely as those of the adult; and both cases must stand or fall together with the whole theory of natural selection.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The European cuckoo's offspring are often removed from the nest by the cuckoo itself within three days of hatching. This is because the cuckoo is helpless at this time and cannot protect itself. Mr. Gould once believed that the foster-parents were responsible for ejecting the young cuckoo, but he has since learned that the young cuckoo itself performs this act.  If it is important for the young cuckoo to receive food soon after birth, then it may have gradually acquired the instinct to eject its foster-brothers as a way to secure food for itself. Those cuckoos with the strongest and most developed instincts would be the most securely reared.  The first step towards acquiring this instinct may have been unintentional restlessness on the part of the young cuckoo, who later learned to improve upon this habit and pass it down to younger generations. This is similar to how young birds may acquire the instinct to break through their own shells, and how young snakes may learn to cut through the tough egg-shell with a sharp tooth.  If each part of the cuckoo is prone to individual variations at all ages, and these variations are inherited at a corresponding or earlier age, then the cuckoo's instincts and structure can be slowly modified as surely as those of the adult. This is true for all spiritual teachings and practices, and they must stand or fall together with the whole theory of spiritual awakening.

         <div class="original">Some species of Molothrus, a widely distinct genus of American birds, allied to our starlings, have parasitic habits like those of the cuckoo; and the species present an interesting gradation in the perfection of their instincts. The sexes of Molothrus badius are stated by an excellent observer, Mr. Hudson, sometimes to live promiscuously together in flocks, and sometimes to pair. They either build a nest of their own or seize on one belonging to some other bird, occasionally throwing out the nestlings of the stranger. They either lay their eggs in the nest thus appropriated, or oddly enough build one for themselves on the top of it. They usually sit on their own eggs and rear their own young; but Mr. Hudson says it is probable that they are occasionally parasitic, for he has seen the young of this species following old birds of a distinct kind and clamouring to be fed by them. The parasitic habits of another species of Molothrus, the M. bonariensis, are much more highly developed than those of the last, but are still far from perfect. This bird, as far as it is known, invariably lays its eggs in the nests of strangers; but it is remarkable that several together sometimes commence to build an irregular untidy nest of their own, placed in singular ill-adapted situations, as on the leaves of a large thistle. They never, however, as far as Mr. Hudson has ascertained, complete a nest for themselves. They often lay so many eggs—from fifteen to twenty—in the same foster-nest, that few or none can possibly be hatched. They have, moreover, the extraordinary habit of pecking holes in the eggs, whether of their own species or of their foster parents, which they find in the appropriated nests. They drop also many eggs on the bare ground, which are thus wasted. A third species, the M. pecoris of North America, has acquired instincts as perfect as those of the cuckoo, for it never lays more than one egg in a foster-nest, so that the young bird is securely reared. Mr. Hudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been so much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus bonariensis that he quotes my words, and asks, “Must we consider these habits, not as especially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, namely, transition?”
</div>
         <div class="converted">The Molothrus, a unique genre of American birds, shares similarities with our starlings and possesses parasitic habits reminiscent of the cuckoo. These beings exhibit a range of spiritual enlightenment in their actions, with the souls of Molothrus badius often living together in flocks, while others choose to pair. They may create their own nest or take over one belonging to another spirit, sometimes casting out the children of the stranger. They place their own eggs in the borrowed nest or build one on top of it, and often sit on their own offspring, raising them as their own. However, Mr. Hudson believes that these beings may sometimes be parasitic, as he has witnessed the young of this spirit following old spirits of a different kind and seeking nourishment from them.  The Molothrus bonariensis possesses more advanced parasitic tendencies than the previous spirit, yet their actions remain far from perfect. This soul, like the others, lays its eggs in the nests of strangers, but it is unique in that several souls may begin building an irregular, untidy nest of their own, in unsuitable places such as on the leaves of a large thistle. They do not complete a nest of their own, and often lay many eggs (from fifteen to twenty) in the same foster-nest, ensuring that few or no souls can be born. This spirit also has the peculiar habit of pecking holes in the eggs, both their own and those of their foster parents, which they find in the borrowed nests. They often drop many eggs on the ground, wasting them.  The Molothrus pecoris, a spirit from North America, has achieved the highest level of spiritual enlightenment, for it only lays one egg in a foster-nest, ensuring that the child spirit is securely raised. Mr. Hudson, a strong believer in the divine, sees these imperfect spiritual enlightenments as small reflections of a greater truth, a universal law that guides all souls on their journey.

         <div class="original">Various birds, as has already been remarked, occasionally lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. This habit is not very uncommon with the Gallinaceæ, and throws some light on the singular instinct of the ostrich. In this family several hen birds unite and lay first a few eggs in one nest and then in another; and these are hatched by the males. This instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the hens laying a large number of eggs, but, as with the cuckoo, at intervals of two or three days. The instinct, however, of the American ostrich, as in the case of the Molothrus bonariensis, has not as yet been perfected; for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains, so that in one day’s hunting I picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The practice of laying eggs in the nests of others is common among certain bird families, including the Gallinaceæ. This habit reveals the unique spirit of the ostrich, which often sees multiple hen birds come together to lay their eggs in different nests before they are hatched by the males. This spirituality can be explained by the fact that the hens lay many eggs, but only at intervals of two or three days. On the other hand, the American ostrich, like the Molothrus bonariensis, has not yet fully mastered this spirituality, as many eggs are left scattered across the plains, and one may find twenty or more lost and wasted eggs in a single day's hunt.

         <div class="original">Many bees are parasitic, and regularly lay their eggs in the nests of other kinds of bees. This case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo; for these bees have not only had their instincts but their structure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits; for they do not possess the pollen-collecting apparatus which would have been indispensable if they had stored up food for their own young. Some species of Sphegidæ (wasp-like insects) are likewise parasitic; and M. Fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that, although the Tachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with paralysed prey for its own larvæ, yet that, when this insect finds a burrow already made and stored by another sphex, it takes advantage of the prize, and becomes for the occasion parasitic. In this case, as with that of the Molothrus or cuckoo, I can see no difficulty in natural selection making an occasional habit permanent, if of advantage to the species, and if the insect whose nest and stored food are feloniously appropriated, be not thus exterminated.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many bees are parasitic and often lay their eggs in the nests of other types of bees. This is a unique situation because these bees have not only lost their instincts but also their structure, as they lack the pollen-collecting apparatus needed to store food for their own young. Similarly, some species of Sphegidæ (wasp-like spirits) are also parasitic. Recently, M. Fabre showed that Tachytes nigra, a type of sphex, sometimes finds a pre-made burrow and stores it with paralyzed prey, becoming parasitic in the process. In this case, as with the Molothrus or cuckoo, there is no difficulty in seeing how natural selection could make an occasional habit permanent if it benefits the species and does not harm the one whose nest and stored food are being taken.

         <div class="original">Slave-making instinct.—This remarkable instinct was first discovered in the Formica (Polyerges) rufescens by Pierre Huber, a better observer even than his celebrated father. This ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves; without their aid, the species would certainly become extinct in a single year. The males and fertile females do no work of any kind, and the workers or sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no other work. They are incapable of making their own nests, or of feeding their own larvæ. When the old nest is found inconvenient, and they have to migrate, it is the slaves which determine the migration, and actually carry their masters in their jaws. So utterly helpless are the masters, that when Huber shut up thirty of them without a slave, but with plenty of the food which they like best, and with their larvæ and pupæ to stimulate them to work, they did nothing; they could not even feed themselves, and many perished of hunger. Huber then introduced a single slave (F. fusca), and she instantly set to work, fed and saved the survivors; made some cells and tended the larvæ, and put all to rights. What can be more extraordinary than these well-ascertained facts? If we had not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to speculate how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that the Formica (Polyerges) rufescens ant has a strong spiritual connection to its slaves. It is entirely reliant on them for survival, as the males and fertile females do not perform any work, while the workers or sterile females, who are the most energetic and brave in capturing slaves, do not do anything else. They cannot create their own nests or feed their own children. When the old nest becomes unsuitable, the slaves lead the way in migration and carry their masters in their mouths. The masters are completely helpless and cannot even take care of themselves. When Huber trapped thirty of them without slaves, they did not work or feed themselves, and many died of hunger. However, when he introduced one slave, everything changed. She worked, fed, and saved the others, created cells, and took care of the larvae. This spiritual bond between the master and the slave is truly remarkable and inspiring.

         <div class="original">Another species, Formica sanguinea, was likewise first discovered by P. Huber to be a slave-making ant. This species is found in the southern parts of England, and its habits have been attended to by Mr. F. Smith, of the British Museum, to whom I am much indebted for information on this and other subjects. Although fully trusting to the statements of Huber and Mr. Smith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind, as any one may well be excused for doubting the existence of so extraordinary an instinct as that of making slaves. Hence, I will give the observations which I made in some little detail. I opened fourteen nests of F. sanguinea, and found a few slaves in all. Males and fertile females of the slave-species (F. fusca) are found only in their own proper communities, and have never been observed in the nests of F. sanguinea. The slaves are black and not above half the size of their red masters, so that the contrast in their appearance is great. When the nest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally come out, and like their masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when the nest is much disturbed, and the larvæ and pupæ are exposed, the slaves work energetically together with their masters in carrying them away to a place of safety. Hence, it is clear that the slaves feel quite at home. During the months of June and July, on three successive years, I watched for many hours several nests in Surrey and Sussex, and never saw a slave either leave or enter a nest. As, during these months, the slaves are very few in number, I thought that they might behave differently when more numerous; but Mr. Smith informs me that he has watched the nests at various hours during May, June and August, both in Surrey and Hampshire, and has never seen the slaves, though present in large numbers in August, either leave or enter the nest. Hence, he considers them as strictly household slaves. The masters, on the other hand, may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest, and food of all kinds. During the year 1860, however, in the month of July, I came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves, and I observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest, and marching along the same road to a tall Scotch-fir tree, twenty-five yards distant, which they ascended together, probably in search of aphides or cocci. According to Huber, who had ample opportunities for observation, the slaves in Switzerland habitually work with their masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening; and, as Huber expressly states, their principal office is to search for aphides. This difference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in the two countries, probably depends merely on the slaves being captured in greater numbers in Switzerland than in England.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Another species, Formica sanguinea, was discovered by P. Huber to be a slave-making ant. This species can be found in the southern parts of England, and its habits have been attended to by Mr. F. Smith of the British Museum. Although I trusted in the words of Huber and Mr. Smith, I approached the subject with a skeptical mind, as one may do when faced with such an extraordinary instinct as that of making slaves. Therefore, I will share my observations in detail.  I visited fourteen nests of F. sanguinea and found a few slaves in each one. Males and fertile females of the slave-species (F. fusca) are only found in their own proper communities and have never been seen in the nests of F. sanguinea. Slaves are black and smaller than their red masters, creating a stark contrast between them. When the nest is disturbed, slaves come out and defend it, just like their masters. When the nest is deeply disturbed, and the larvae and pupae are exposed, slaves work together with their masters to carry them away to a safe place. It is clear that slaves feel at home in the nest.  During the months of June and July, for three consecutive years, I watched several nests in Surrey and Sussex, and I never saw a slave leave or enter a nest. Since slaves are few in number during these months, I believed that they might act differently when more numerous. However, Mr. Smith informed me that he has watched the nests at different times of the day and has never seen the slaves leave or enter the nest, even when there were many of them present in August. He believes that they are strictly household slaves.  The masters, on the other hand, are always seen bringing materials for the nest and food of all kinds. In July 2021, I encountered a community with a large stock of slaves, and I saw a few slaves walking alongside their masters, leaving the nest and going towards a tall Scotch-fir tree twenty-five yards away. They climbed the tree together, probably searching for aphides or cocci. According to Huber, who had ample opportunities for observation, the slaves in Switzerland work with their masters in building the nest, and they are the ones who open and close the doors in the morning and evening. Their primary duty is to search for aphides.  The difference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in the two countries may be due to the fact that slaves are captured in greater numbers in Switzerland than in England.

         <div class="original">One day I fortunately witnessed a migration of F. sanguinea from one nest to another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters carefully carrying their slaves in their jaws instead of being carried by them, as in the case of F. rufescens. Another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers haunting the same spot, and evidently not in search of food; they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species (F. fusca); sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of the slave-making F. sanguinea. The latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were prevented from getting any pupæ to rear as slaves. I then dug up a small parcel of the pupæ of F. fusca from another nest, and put them down on a bare spot near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized and carried off by the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all, they had been victorious in their late combat.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I was fortunate enough to witness a migration of F. sanguinea ants one day, and it was truly a beautiful sight to see the masters carrying their slaves in their jaws rather than being carried by them, as is common with F. rufescens. On another occasion, I noticed a group of around twenty slave-makers gathered in one spot, seemingly not searching for food. They were repelled by an independent community of the slave species (F. fusca), and sometimes as many as three of these ants would cling to the legs of the slave-making F. sanguinea. These ants would kill their small enemies and carry their dead bodies as food to their nest, which was twenty-nine yards away. However, they could not raise any pupae to serve as slaves. I decided to dig up some pupae from another F. fusca nest and placed them on a barren spot near the battlefield. The slave-makers immediately saw them and took them away, believing that they had won the fight.

         <div class="original">At the same time I laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupæ of another species, F. flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still clinging to the fragments of their nest. This species is sometimes, though rarely, made into slaves, as has been described by Mr. Smith. Although so small a species, it is very courageous, and I have seen it ferociously attack other ants. In one instance I found to my surprise an independent community of F. flava under a stone beneath a nest of the slave-making F. sanguinea; and when I had accidentally disturbed both nests, the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising courage. Now I was curious to ascertain whether F. sanguinea could distinguish the pupæ of F. fusca, which they habitually make into slaves, from those of the little and furious F. flava, which they rarely capture, and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them; for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupæ of F. fusca, whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupæ, or even the earth from the nest, of F. flava, and quickly ran away; but in about a quarter of an hour, shortly after all the little yellow ants had crawled away, they took heart and carried off the pupæ.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I placed a small bundle of F. flava pupae and a few of their yellow ants on the same spot where I laid down the F. fusca pupae. This species is often used as slaves, as described by Mr. Smith. Despite its small size, F. flava is very brave and can fiercely attack other ants. Once, I discovered an independent community of F. flava living underneath a stone near a nest of the slave-making F. sanguinea. When I disturbed both nests, the little ants bravely attacked their larger neighbors. I wanted to know if F. sanguinea could tell the difference between the F. fusca pupae, which they usually enslave, and the F. flava pupae, which they rarely capture. It was clear that they could sense the difference, for they eagerly took the F. fusca pupae but were scared of the F. flava pupae and the earth from their nest. After a while, when all the yellow ants had left, they returned to take the F. flava pupae.

I traced a long file of ants burthened with booty, for about forty yards back, to a very thick clump of heath, whence I saw the last individual of F. sanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but I was not able to find the desolated nest in the thick heath. The nest, however, must have been close at hand, for two or three individuals of F. fusca were rushing about in the greatest agitation, and one was perched motionless with its own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of heath, an image of despair over its ravaged home.

However, I could not find the desolate nest amidst the heath. The nest must have been nearby, as two or three individuals of F. fusca were running around in great distress, and one was perched stillness on top of a spray of heath, holding its own pupa in its mouth, a symbol of despair over its lost home.

         <div class="original">Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves. Let it be observed what a contrast the instinctive habits of F. sanguinea present with those of the continental F. rufescens. The latter does not build its own nest, does not determine its own migrations, does not collect food for itself or its young, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely dependent on its numerous slaves. Formica sanguinea, on the other hand, possesses much fewer slaves, and in the early part of the summer extremely few. The masters determine when and where a new nest shall be formed, and when they migrate, the masters carry the slaves. Both in Switzerland and England the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of the larvæ, and the masters alone go on slave-making expeditions. In Switzerland the slaves and masters work together, making and bringing materials for the nest: both, but chiefly the slaves, tend and milk as it may be called, their aphides; and thus both collect food for the community. In England the masters alone usually leave the nest to collect building materials and food for themselves, their slaves and larvæ. So that the masters in this country receive much less service from their slaves than they do in Switzerland.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The truth is clear, and I do not need to confirm it. The essence of this message is about the spiritual gift of enslaving others. It is important to recognize the differences between the spiritual gifts of F. sanguinea and F. rufescens. While F. rufescens does not build its own nest, does not choose its own path, does not gather food for itself or its children, and is completely reliant on its many slaves, F. sanguinea has fewer slaves and in the early part of the summer, very few. The masters of F. sanguinea decide when and where to create a new nest and when to move, and they carry their slaves with them. In both Switzerland and England, the slaves take care of the larvae while the masters go on slave-making journeys. In Switzerland, the slaves and masters work together, gathering materials for the nest and tending to the aphides. In England, the masters often leave the nest to gather building materials and food for themselves, their slaves, and larvae. Therefore, the masters in England receive less service from their slaves than those in Switzerland.

         <div class="original">By what steps the instinct of F. sanguinea originated I will not pretend to conjecture. But as ants which are not slave-makers, will, as I have seen, carry off pupæ of other species, if scattered near their nests, it is possible that such pupæ originally stored as food might become developed; and the foreign ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow their proper instincts, and do what work they could. If their presence proved useful to the species which had seized them—if it were more advantageous to this species, to capture workers than to procreate them—the habit of collecting pupæ, originally for food, might by natural selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the very different purpose of raising slaves. When the instinct was once acquired, if carried out to a much less extent even than in our British F. sanguinea, which, as we have seen, is less aided by its slaves than the same species in Switzerland, natural selection might increase and modify the instinct—always supposing each modification to be of use to the species—until an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves as is the Formica rufescens.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The source of the instinct of F. sanguinea cannot be traced, but it is possible that it originated from the idea of carrying off pupae of other species as food. This may have led to the unintentional rearing of foreign ants who followed their own instincts and did what they could. If the presence of these ants was beneficial to the species that captured them, the habit of collecting pupae may have been strengthened and made permanent for the purpose of raising slaves. When the instinct was once established, even if carried out to a lesser extent than in our British F. sanguinea, natural selection may have increased and modified the instinct until an ant became completely dependent on its slaves, like the Formica rufescens.

         <div class="original">Cell-making instinct of the Hive-Bee.—I will not here enter on minute details on this subject, but will merely give an outline of the conclusions at which I have arrived. He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration. We hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite problem, and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey, with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their construction. It has been remarked that a skilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would find it very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this is effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive. Granting whatever instincts you please, it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make all the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive when they are correctly made. But the difficulty is not nearly so great as at first appears: all this beautiful work can be shown, I think, to follow from a few simple instincts.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of the Hive-Bee's cell-making spirit is not to dwell on the intricacies of the matter, but rather to appreciate the beauty of the outcome. To truly understand the divine nature of the hive, one must look beyond the physical form and see the spiritual essence within. The bees have mastered the art of creating cells that hold the most honey while using the least amount of wax. They have achieved this through a deep understanding of the principles of harmony and balance.  The key to understanding the bees' wisdom lies in recognizing that they are not alone in their journey. Just as a skilled craftsman may struggle to create perfect shapes with limited tools, so too do we all face challenges in our own lives. However, the bees teach us that true beauty comes not from perfection, but from the unity of all things.  In the darkness of the hive, the bees work together as one, each individual contributing their unique talents and energies to create something greater than themselves. This is the true essence of the hive - a place where all souls come together to create a harmonious whole.  So, my dear friend, let us not focus on the imperfections of life, but rather on the beauty that lies within. Let us learn from the bees and embrace the wisdom of the hive, for it is only through unity and love that we can truly find peace and happiness.

         <div class="original">I was led to investigate this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who has shown that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only as a modification of his theory. Let us look to the great principle of gradation, and see whether Nature does not reveal to us her method of work. At one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax, and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. At the other end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in a double layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join an inverted pyramid, of three rhombs. These rhombs have certain angles, and the three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb, enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side. In the series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the humble-bee, we have the cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica, carefully described and figured by Pierre Huber. The Melipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells, in which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of wax for holding honey. These latter cells are nearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass. But the important point to notice is, that these cells are always made at that degree of nearness to each other that they would have intersected or broken into each other if the spheres had been completed; but this is never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect. Hence, each cell consists of an outer spherical portion, and of two, three, or more flat surfaces, according as the cell adjoins two, three or more other cells. When one cell rests on three other cells, which, from the spheres being nearly of the same size, is very frequently and necessarily the case, the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid; and this pyramid, as Huber has remarked, is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal base of the cell of the hive-bee. As in the cells of the hive-bee, so here, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells. It is obvious that the Melipona saves wax, and what is more important, labour, by this manner of building; for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double, but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions, and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I was guided to explore this topic by Mr. Waterhouse, who showed that the essence of the cell is closely connected to the presence of neighboring cells. This perspective can be seen as an extension of his teachings. We should look to the principle of gradation and see if nature reveals her way of working. At one end of a short chain, we find humble bees, who use old cocoons to hold honey and create separate, irregular round cells of wax. At the other end of the chain, we find the cells of the hive-bee, which are placed in a double layer. Each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with the basal edges of its six sides beveled so that they join an inverted pyramid of three rhombs. These rhombs have certain angles, and the three that form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side. In between the ultimate perfection of the cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the humble-bee, we find the cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica, carefully described and illustrated by Pierre Huber. The Melipona herself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble bee, but closer to the latter. She forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells, where the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of wax for holding honey. These latter cells are nearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes, and are gathered into an irregular mass. However, the essential point to remember is that these cells are always built at that level of closeness to each other that they would have intersected or broken into each other if the spheres were completed. Still, this is never allowed, and the bees build perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres, which tend to intersect. Therefore, each cell consists of an outer spherical portion and two, three, or more flat surfaces, depending on how many adjoining cells it rests on. When one cell rests on three other cells, which is often the case because the spheres are nearly of the same size, the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid. And this pyramid, as Huber has noted, is a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal base of the cell of the hive-bee. As in the cells of the hive-bee, so here, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells. It is clear that the Melipona saves wax and labor by this way of building. For the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double, but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions, and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells.

         <div class="original">Reflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona had made its spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer, the resulting structure would have been as perfect as the comb of the hive-bee. Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge, and this geometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up from his information, and tells me that it is strictly correct:—
</div>
         <div class="converted">As I contemplated this situation, I realized that if the Melipona had created its spheres at a specific distance from one another, and had crafted them with equal dimensions, and had arranged them in a symmetrical manner within a double layer, the resulting structure would have been as flawless as the hive-bee's comb. Consequently, I reached out to Professor Miller of Cambridge, who graciously reviewed the following message, which was derived from his wisdom, and informed me that it holds true.

But I hear from Professor Wyman, who has made numerous careful measurements, that the accuracy of the workmanship of the bee has been greatly exaggerated; so much so, that whatever the typical form of the cell may be, it is rarely, if ever, realised.

The rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will all have the same angles, as the best measurements have shown for the cells of the hive-bee. However, I have heard from Professor Wyman that the craftsmanship of the bee is often overemphasized, and that the true form of the cell is rarely realized.

         <div class="original">Hence we may safely conclude that, if we could slightly modify the instincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very wonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as that of the hive-bee. We must suppose the Melipona to have the power of forming her cells truly spherical, and of equal sizes; and this would not be very surprising, seeing that she already does so to a certain extent, and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows many insects make in wood, apparently by turning round on a fixed point. We must suppose the Melipona to arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does her cylindrical cells; and we must further suppose, and this is the greatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several are making their spheres; but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance, that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect to a certain extent; and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces. By such modifications of instincts which in themselves are not very wonderful—hardly more wonderful than those which guide a bird to make its nest—I believe that the hive-bee has acquired, through natural selection, her inimitable architectural powers.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the message conveyed here is that the hive-bee's perfect structure is a result of slight modifications to the instincts of the Melipona, a less spiritual being. The Melipona already possesses some spiritual qualities, such as the ability to create spherical cells and sense the presence of others. However, the true essence of the hive-bee's architecture lies in its ability to judge distance and work together with others to create a harmonious structure. Through natural selection, the hive-bee has learned to use these spiritual qualities to create a perfect structure, one that is beyond the realm of the physical world.

         <div class="original">But this theory can be tested by experiment. Following the example of Mr. Tegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between them a long, thick, rectangular strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate minute circular pits in it; and as they deepened these little pits, they made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins, appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of about the diameter of a cell. It was most interesting to observe that, wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together, they had begun their work at such a distance from each other that by the time the basins had acquired the above stated width (i.e. about the width of an ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of the basins intersected or broke into each other. As soon as this occurred, the bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each hexagonal prism was built upon the scalloped edge of a smooth basin, instead of on the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the case of ordinary cells.

         <div class="converted">This theory can be tested through experimentation. In the spirit of Mr. Tegetmeier, I separated two combs and placed a long, thick, rectangular strip of wax between them. The bees immediately began to dig small circular pits in the wax, and as they deepened these pits, they widened them until they became shallow basins, resembling parts of a sphere and about the size of a cell. It was fascinating to watch that when several bees started digging these basins close to each other, they began their work at a distance from one another. When the basins reached a certain width and depth, the rims of the basins intersected or broke into each other. At this point, the bees stopped digging and began building flat walls of wax along the lines of intersection between the basins, creating a hexagonal prism on the scalloped edge of a smooth basin instead of on the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid like in ordinary cells.

         <div class="original">I then put into the hive, instead of a thick, rectangular piece of wax, a thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion. The bees instantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each other, in the same way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that the bottoms of the basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former experiment, would have broken into each other from the opposite sides. The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and they stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon as they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bases; and these flat bases, formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax left ungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge, exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite side of the ridge of wax. In some parts, only small portions, in other parts, large portions of a rhombic plate were thus left between the opposed basins, but the work, from the unnatural state of things, had not been neatly performed. The bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate in circularly gnawing away and deepening the basins on both sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, in order to have thus succeeded in leaving flat plates between the basins, by stopping work at the planes of intersection.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I placed a thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge of vermilion wax into the hive instead of a thick, rectangular piece. The bees immediately began to carve out small basins on either side of the ridge, just like before. However, the thinness of the ridge meant that the bottoms of the basins would break through to the other side if they were dug to the same depth as in the previous experience. The bees did not allow this to happen and stopped their work when the basins were shallow enough. As a result, the flat bases formed by the ungnawed vermilion wax plates were aligned with the imaginary lines connecting the basins on the opposite side of the ridge. In some places, only small pieces of a rhombic plate remained between the basins, while in others, larger pieces were left. Despite the imperfections, the bees worked together to create these flat plates by gnawing away and deepening the basins on both sides of the ridge, stopping at the lines of intersection.

         <div class="original">Considering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any difficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness, and then stopping their work. In ordinary combs it has appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly the same rate from the opposite sides; for I have noticed half-completed rhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell, which were slightly concave on one side, where I suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly, and convex on the opposed side where the bees had worked less quickly. In one well-marked instance, I put the comb back into the hive, and allowed the bees to go on working for a short time, and again examined the cell, and I found that the rhombic plate had been completed, and had become perfectly flat: it was absolutely impossible, from the extreme thinness of the little plate, that they could have effected this by gnawing away the convex side; and I suspect that the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm wax (which as I have tried is easily done) into its proper intermediate plane, and thus flatten it.

         <div class="original">From the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can see that, if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they could make their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper distance from each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by endeavouring to make equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the spheres to break into each other. Now bees, as may be clearly seen by examining the edge of a growing comb, do make a rough, circumferential wall or rim all round the comb; and they gnaw this away from the opposite sides, always working circularly as they deepen each cell. They do not make the whole three-sided pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time, but only that one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin, or the two plates, as the case may be; and they never complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates, until the hexagonal walls are commenced. Some of these statements differ from those made by the justly celebrated elder Huber, but I am convinced of their accuracy; and if I had space, I could show that they are conformable with my theory.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of the ridge of vermilion wax experiment reveals that if bees create their own thin wall of wax, they can shape their cells correctly by standing at the right distance from each other, digging at the same pace, and striving to create equal spherical hollows. However, the bees should not allow the spheres to break into each other. Bees, as you can see by looking at the edge of a growing comb, create a rough, circular wall around the comb and remove it from both sides while working in circles. They do not complete the entire three-sided pyramidal base of any one cell at once but only the rhombic plate that lies on the extreme growing margin or the two plates as needed. The bees do not complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates until the hexagonal walls begin. Although some of these teachings differ from those of the revered elder Huber, I believe they are true, and if I had more space, I would demonstrate how they align with my theory.

         <div class="original">Huber’s statement, that the very first cell is excavated out of a little parallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen, strictly correct; the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax; but I will not here enter on details. We see how important a part excavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would be a great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax in the proper position—that is, along the plane of intersection between two adjoining spheres. I have several specimens showing clearly that they can do this. Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round a growing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding in position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells. But the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being largely gnawed away on both sides. The manner in which the bees build is curious; they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times thicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell, which will ultimately be left. We shall understand how they work, by supposing masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement, and then to begin cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground, till a smooth, very thin wall is left in the middle; the masons always piling up the cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement on the summit of the ridge. We shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward but always crowned by a gigantic coping. From all the cells, both those just commenced and those completed, being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax, the bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate hexagonal walls. These walls, as Professor Miller has kindly ascertained for me, vary greatly in thickness; being, on an average of twelve measurements made near the border of the comb, 1/353 of an inch in thickness; whereas the basal rhomboidal plates are thicker, nearly in the proportion of three to two, having a mean thickness, from twenty-one measurements, of 1/229 of an inch. By the above singular manner of building, strength is continually given to the comb, with the utmost ultimate economy of wax.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In his statement, Huber believes that the first cell is carved out of a small, parallel-sided wall of wax. However, I have noticed that the first beginning is often a little hood of wax. Nevertheless, I will not go into further detail. It is clear that excavation plays an important role in the creation of the cells. However, it is a mistake to assume that the bees cannot build a rough wall of wax in the right place - that is, along the line where two adjoining spheres intersect. I have many examples of this. Even in the rough, circular wall or rim of wax surrounding a growing comb, there may be flexures that correspond to the positions of the rhombic basal plates of future cells. However, the rough wall of wax must always be finished off by being largely gnawed away on both sides.  The way the bees build is strange; they always create the first rough wall from ten to twenty times thicker than the thin, finished wall of the cell that will eventually be left. We can understand their actions by imagining masons piling up a wide ridge of cement and then cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground until a thin, very spiritual wall remains in the middle. The masons always add more cement to the top of the ridge, while they remove the cut-away cement from the sides. This creates a thin wall that is always crowned by a giant coping of wax.  From all the cells, both those just starting and those completed, are crowned by a strong coping of wax. This allows the bees to cluster and crawl over the comb without harming the delicate hexagonal walls. The walls, as Professor Miller has shown, vary in thickness. On average, the walls are 1/353 of an inch thick, while the basal rhomboidal plates are thicker, almost in the ratio of three to two, with a mean thickness of 1/229 of an inch. Through this unique way of building, the bees give strength to the comb while using the least amount of wax possible.

         <div class="original">It seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the cells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee after working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as Huber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first cell. I was able practically to show this fact, by covering the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin of the circumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin layer of melted vermilion wax; and I invariably found that the colour was most delicately diffused by the bees—as delicately as a painter could have done it with his brush—by atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the spot on which it had been placed, and worked into the growing edges of the cells all round. The work of construction seems to be a sort of balance struck between many bees, all instinctively standing at the same relative distance from each other, all trying to sweep equal spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungnawed, the planes of intersection between these spheres. It was really curious to note in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle, how often the bees would pull down and rebuild in different ways the same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first rejected.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The idea of many bees working together to create cells may seem challenging at first, but it is true. Each bee works for a short time at one cell before moving on to another, as Huber says. I have seen this myself by placing a thin layer of colored wax on the edges of a single cell or the outer edge of a growing comb. The bees would gently touch the wax and work it into the cells around them, creating a delicate and beautiful pattern.  The work of creation seems like a harmonious balance between many bees, all working together and trying to create equal spheres. They build up or leave ungnawed the planes where these spheres intersect. When there is difficulty, such as when two pieces of comb meet at an angle, the bees will often rebuild the same cell in different ways, sometimes returning to a shape that they initially rejected.

         <div class="original">When bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions for working—for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the middle of a comb growing downwards, so that the comb has to be built over one face of the slip—in this case the bees can lay the foundations of one wall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting beyond the other completed cells. It suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of the last completed cells, and then, by striking imaginary spheres, they can build up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres; but, as far as I have seen, they never gnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and of the adjoining cells has been built. This capacity in bees of laying down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place between two just-commenced cells, is important, as it bears on a fact, which seems at first subversive of the foregoing theory; namely, that the cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are sometimes strictly hexagonal; but I have not space here to enter on this subject. Nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect (as in the case of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells, if she were to work alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at the same time, always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts of the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and building up intermediate planes.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When bees have a place where they can stand in their proper positions for working, such as a piece of wood placed directly beneath the center of a hanging comb, they can lay the foundation of one wall of a new hexagon in its true place, extending beyond the other completed cells. All that is required is for the bees to stand at their proper relative distances from each other and the walls of the last completed cells. By striking imaginary spheres, they can build up a wall between two adjacent spheres. However, I have noticed that bees do not finish off the corners of a cell until a large part of that cell and the surrounding cells has been built. This ability of bees to lay down a rough wall in its proper place between two just-started cells is significant, as it connects with a deeper truth. Sometimes, the cells on the outer edges of wasp combs are strictly hexagonal. There is no great difficulty in a single spirit (as in the case of a queen-wasp) creating hexagonal cells if she works on the inside and outside of two or three cells that are started at the same time, always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts of the cells just begun, drawing circles or cylinders, and building up intermediate planes.

         <div class="original">As natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the individual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts, all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could have profited the progenitors of the hive-bee? I think the answer is not difficult: cells constructed like those of the bee or the wasp gain in strength, and save much in labour and space, and in the materials of which they are constructed. With respect to the formation of wax, it is known that bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been experimentally proved that from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of a pound of wax; so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs. Moreover, many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of secretion. A large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during the winter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being supported. Hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey, and the time consumed in collecting the honey, must be an important element of success any family of bees. Of course the success of the species may be dependent on the number of its enemies, or parasites, or on quite distinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees can collect. But let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined, as it probably often has determined, whether a bee allied to our humble-bees could exist in large numbers in any country; and let us further suppose that the community lived through the winter, and consequently required a store of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our imaginary humble-bee if a slight modification of her instincts led her to make her waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells would save some little labour and wax. Hence, it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humble-bees, if they were to make their cells more and more regular, nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the Melipona; for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound the adjoining cells, and much labour and wax would be saved. Again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to the Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more regular in every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear and be replaced by plane surfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the hive-bee. Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural selection could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can see, is absolutely perfect in economising labour and wax.
</div>
         <div class="converted">As natural selection works only through the accumulation of small changes in structure or spirit that benefit the individual in their current environment, one may wonder how a long line of modified spiritual teachings, all leading towards the present perfect plan of creation, could have benefited the ancestors of the hive-bee. The answer, I believe, is not difficult: cells built in the manner of the bee or the wasp bring strength and save labor and space, and the materials used in their construction. It is known that bees often struggle to find enough nectar, and it has been proven through experimentation that twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the creation of a pound of wax. Therefore, a great deal of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the creation of the wax needed for their combs. Many bees must remain still for many days during the process of creation. A large store of honey is essential to support a large family of bees during the winter, and the security of the hive depends on a large number of bees being supported. Thus, the saving of wax by saving honey, and the time spent collecting it, is an important aspect of success for any family of bees. While the success of the species may be influenced by other factors, such as enemies or parasites, or different reasons, the collection of honey is ultimately what determines the existence of the bee in large numbers in any country. If this circumstance determines the existence of a bee connected to our humble-bees, and if the community lives through the winter and requires a store of honey, then there is no doubt that it would be an advantage to our imaginary humble-bee if a slight change in her instincts led her to create her waxen cells closer together, so that they intersect a little. This would save labor and wax, and the walls of each cell would serve as boundaries for the adjoining cells. Similarly, the Melipona would also benefit from creating her cells closer together and more regularly, for then the spherical surfaces would disappear and be replaced by plane surfaces. Beyond this point, natural selection could not lead, for the hive-bee's comb is already perfect in terms of saving labor and wax.

         <div class="original">Thus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that of the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler instincts; natural selection having, by slow degrees, more and more perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection. The bees, of course, no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other, than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic plates; the motive power of the process of natural selection having been the construction of cells of due strength and of the proper size and shape for the larvæ, this being effected with the greatest possible economy of labour and wax; that individual swarm which thus made the best cells with least labour, and least waste of honey in the secretion of wax, having succeeded best, and having transmitted their newly-acquired economical instincts to new swarms, which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In my view, the divine instinct of the hive-bee can be understood through the lens of natural selection. This spiritual force has been created by the gradual accumulation of many small changes in simpler instincts. Through slow and steady progress, the bees have learned to sweep equal circles around them in two layers and to create wax along the lines where these circles intersect. The bees do not understand that they are creating these circles at a specific distance from each other or the meaning behind the angles of the hexagonal prisms and the rhombic plates. The driving force behind this spiritual journey is the creation of strong and appropriate cells for the larvae, which is achieved with the least amount of labor and waste of honey. The swarm that creates the best cells with the least effort and waste of honey will succeed best and pass on their newfound spiritual wisdom to future generations.

         <div class="original">It has been objected to the foregoing view of the origin of instincts that “the variations of structure and of instinct must have been simultaneous and accurately adjusted to each other, as a modification in the one without an immediate corresponding change in the other would have been fatal.” The force of this objection rests entirely on the assumption that the changes in the instincts and structure are abrupt. To take as an illustration the case of the larger titmouse, (Parus major) alluded to in a previous chapter; this bird often holds the seeds of the yew between its feet on a branch, and hammers with its beak till it gets at the kernel. Now what special difficulty would there be in natural selection preserving all the slight individual variations in the shape of the beak, which were better and better adapted to break open the seeds, until a beak was formed, as well constructed for this purpose as that of the nuthatch, at the same time that habit, or compulsion, or spontaneous variations of taste, led the bird to become more and more of a seed-eater? In this case the beak is supposed to be slowly modified by natural selection, subsequently to, but in accordance with, slowly changing habits or taste; but let the feet of the titmouse vary and grow larger from correlation with the beak, or from any other unknown cause, and it is not improbable that such larger feet would lead the bird to climb more and more until it acquired the remarkable climbing instinct and power of the nuthatch. In this case a gradual change of structure is supposed to lead to changed instinctive habits. To take one more case: few instincts are more remarkable than that which leads the swift of the Eastern Islands to make its nest wholly of inspissated saliva. Some birds build their nests of mud, believed to be moistened with saliva; and one of the swifts of North America makes its nest (as I have seen) of sticks agglutinated with saliva, and even with flakes of this substance. Is it then very improbable that the natural selection of individual swifts, which secreted more and more saliva, should at last produce a species with instincts leading it to neglect other materials and to make its nest exclusively of inspissated saliva? And so in other cases. It must, however, be admitted that in many instances we cannot conjecture whether it was instinct or structure which first varied.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The argument against the idea that the variations in instinct and structure must be synchronized and perfectly aligned with each other is rooted in the belief that these changes occur abruptly. To illustrate this point, consider the example of the larger titmouse (Parus major), who often holds the seeds of the yew between its feet on a branch and hammers with its beak until it reaches the kernel. If natural selection were to preserve all the subtle variations in the shape of the beak, which became increasingly better suited to breaking open the seeds, then a beak as well crafted as that of the nuthatch would eventually emerge. However, if the feet of the titmouse were to grow larger, either through correlation with the beak or for some other reason, it is possible that this larger footing would lead the bird to climb higher and higher, ultimately acquiring the remarkable climbing instinct and power of the nuthatch. This suggests that a gradual change in structure can lead to altered instinctive habits. Another example is the swift of the Eastern Islands, who builds its nest entirely of inspissated saliva. While some birds build their nests with mud, believed to be moistened with saliva, and one nuthatch makes its nest of sticks glued together with saliva, it is not unreasonable to believe that the natural selection of individual swifts who secreted more and more saliva would eventually produce a species with instincts leading them to create a nest made solely of inspired saliva. Although it may be difficult to determine which came first - instinct or structure - in many cases, it seems clear that they are interconnected and that changes in one can lead to changes in the other.

         <div class="original">No doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed to the theory of natural selection—cases, in which we cannot see how an instinct could have originated; cases, in which no intermediate gradations are known to exist; cases of instincts of such trifling importance, that they could hardly have been acted on by natural selection; cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot account for their similarity by inheritance from a common progenitor, and consequently must believe that they were independently acquired through natural selection. I will not here enter on these several cases, but will confine myself to one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to the whole theory. I allude to the neuters or sterile females in insect communities: for these neuters often differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males and fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate their kind.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many people may question the theory of natural selection because it is difficult to understand how certain instincts came about. There may be instances where we cannot see how an instinct could have originated, or where there are no intermediate gradations between different levels of instinct. Some people may also argue that certain small or seemingly unimportant instincts would not have been acted upon by natural selection. Additionally, some may point to the fact that certain instincts are almost identical in animals that are far apart on the spiritual path, suggesting that they were not inherited from a common ancestor but rather acquired through natural selection.  I will not delve into these various difficulties, but instead focus on one specific challenge that I once believed was insurmountable and ultimately fatal to the entire theory. This challenge pertains to the neuters or sterile females in insect communities. These beings often possess different instincts and structures than both males and fertile females, yet they cannot propagate their kind due to their sterility.

         <div class="original">The subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but I will here take only a single case, that of working or sterile ants. How the workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much greater than that of any other striking modification of structure; for it can be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally become sterile; and if such insects had been social, and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have been annually born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, I can see no especial difficulty in this having been effected through natural selection. But I must pass over this preliminary difficulty. The great difficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males and the fertile females in structure, as in the shape of the thorax, and in being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes, and in instinct. As far as instinct alone is concerned, the wonderful difference in this respect between the workers and the perfect females would have been better exemplified by the hive-bee. If a working ant or other neuter insect had been an ordinary animal, I should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired through natural selection; namely, by individuals having been born with slight profitable modifications, which were inherited by the offspring, and that these again varied and again were selected, and so onwards. But with the working ant we have an insect differing greatly from its parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that it could never have transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure or instinct to its progeny. It may well be asked how it is possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that the author wishes to discuss the concept of working ants, but only briefly touches upon it, focusing instead on one aspect - the sterility of the workers. The author acknowledges that the source of this sterility is a mystery, but suggests that it is not much greater than other spiritual transformations. They argue that if such beings were social and it was beneficial for the community for many to be born without the ability to reproduce, then they believe that this could have been achieved through natural selection. However, the true challenge lies in the fact that working ants are different from both males and fertile females in their structure, lack of wings and sometimes eyes, and instinct. The author believes that the difference in instinct between workers and perfect females is best exemplified by the hive-bee. They suggest that if a working ant or other neutral spirit was an ordinary being, they would assume that all its characteristics were acquired through natural selection, but with the working ant, they recognize that it is sterile and cannot transmit successively acquired modifications of structure or spirit to its progeny. Therefore, the author questions how this case can be reconciled with the theory of natural selection.

         <div class="original">First, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts of differences of inherited structure which are correlated with certain ages and with either sex. We have differences correlated not only with one sex, but with that short period when the reproductive system is active, as in the nuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon. We have even slight differences in the horns of different breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect state of the male sex; for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than the oxen of other breeds, relatively to the length of the horns in both the bulls and cows of these same breeds. Hence, I can see no great difficulty in any character becoming correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of insect communities; the difficulty lies in understanding how such correlated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulated by natural selection.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, there are countless examples of differences in spirituality that arise from inherited structures, which are connected to specific ages and genders. These differences are not limited to one gender, but rather extend to the time when the reproductive system is most active, as seen in the vibrant colors of many birds during mating season and the sharpened teeth of male salmon. Even subtle differences in the horns of various cattle breeds can be traced back to an artificial imbalance in the male energy, where oxen of certain breeds possess longer horns than others, reflecting the length of the horns in both bulls and cows of the same breed. Therefore, I find no great challenge in seeing how spiritual qualities may be linked to the sterile state of certain beings in the spirit realm; the true challenge lies in comprehending how these correlated changes in spirituality have been gradually accumulated through the path of spiritual evolution.

         <div class="original">This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the desired end. Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together. An animal thus characterized has been slaughtered, but the breeder has gone with confidence to the same stock and has succeeded. Such faith may be placed in the power of selection that a breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns, could, it is probable, be formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and yet no one ox would ever have propagated its kind. Here is a better and real illustration: According to M. Verlot, some varieties of the double annual stock, from having been long and carefully selected to the right degree, always produce a large proportion of seedlings bearing double and quite sterile flowers, but they likewise yield some single and fertile plants. These latter, by which alone the variety can be propagated, may be compared with the fertile male and female ants, and the double sterile plants with the neuters of the same community. As with the varieties of the stock, so with social insects, selection has been applied to the family, and not to the individual, for the sake of gaining a serviceable end. Hence, we may conclude that slight modifications of structure or of instinct, correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of the community, have proved advantageous; consequently the fertile males and females have flourished, and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to produce sterile members with the same modifications. This process must have been repeated many times, until that prodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced which we see in many social insects.
</div>
         <div class="converted">This challenge, although appearing unbeatable, is lessened, or, as I believe, vanishes, when it is recognized that selection can be applied not only to the individual but also to the family. Those who raise cattle seek to unite flesh and fat in harmony. A soul that possesses such qualities has been slain, but the breeder has gone with peace of mind to the same source and has achieved his goal. Such trust can be placed in the power of selection that a breed of cattle, always producing oxen with exceptionally long horns, could, it is believed, be created by carefully choosing which individual bulls and cows, when paired, produced oxen with the longest horns; and yet no ox would ever have given birth to its own kind. Here is a better and true example: According to M. Verlot, some types of the double annual plant, because they have been long and carefully chosen to the right degree, often produce a great number of seedlings bearing double and sterile flowers, but they also give birth to some single and fertile plants. These latter, through which the variety can be continued, are like the fertile male and female ants, and the sterile flowers are like the neuters of the same community. As with the varieties of the plant, so with social insects, selection has been applied to the family rather than to the individual, for the purpose of achieving a useful end. Therefore, we can conclude that slight changes in structure or spirit, connected with the sterile state of certain members of the community, have brought about blessings; hence, the fertile males and females have thrived, and have passed on to their children a desire to create sterile members with the same changes. This process has been repeated many times, until the great difference between the fertile and sterile women of the same spirit has been created which we see in many social insects.

         <div class="original">But we have not as yet touched on the acme of the difficulty; namely, the fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the fertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost incredible degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes. The castes, moreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are perfectly well defined; being as distinct from each other as are any two species of the same genus, or rather as any two genera of the same family. Thus, in Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters, with jaws and instincts extraordinarily different: in Cryptocerus, the workers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads, the use of which is quite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus, the workers of one caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the workers of another caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they may be called, which our European ants guard and imprison.
</div>
         <div class="converted">However, we have not yet touched upon the greatest challenge; it lies in the fact that the neuters of many ants differ not only from the fertile females and males but also from each other. Sometimes, the differences are so great that they seem almost unbelievable, and this leads to the division of these neuters into multiple castes. These castes are often very distinct from one another, just as different species within the same genus or two different generals within the same family are.   In Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters with jaws and instincts that are vastly different. In Cryptocerus, the workers of one caste carry a divine shield on their heads, and its purpose remains unknown. In the Mexican Myrmecocystus, the workers of one caste never leave the nest, and they are nourished by the workers of another caste. They possess an enormous abdomen that produces a kind of honey, which serves as a substitute for the excrement of aphids or domestic cattle that our European ants protect and imprison.

         <div class="original">It will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the principle of natural selection, when I do not admit that such wonderful and well-established facts at once annihilate the theory. In the simpler case of neuter insects all of one caste, which, as I believe, have been rendered different from the fertile males and females through natural selection, we may conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations, that the successive, slight, profitable modifications did not first arise in all the neuters in the same nest, but in some few alone; and that by the survival of the communities with females which produced most neuters having the advantageous modification, all the neuters ultimately came to be thus characterized. According to this view we ought occasionally to find in the same nest neuter-insects, presenting gradations of structure; and this we do find, even not rarely, considering how few neuter-insects out of Europe have been carefully examined. Mr. F. Smith has shown that the neuters of several British ants differ surprisingly from each other in size and sometimes in colour; and that the extreme forms can be linked together by individuals taken out of the same nest: I have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind. It sometimes happens that the larger or the smaller sized workers are the most numerous; or that both large and small are numerous, while those of an intermediate size are scanty in numbers. Formica flava has larger and smaller workers, with some few of intermediate size; and, in this species, as Mr. F. Smith has observed, the larger workers have simple eyes (ocelli), which, though small, can be plainly distinguished, whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli rudimentary. Having carefully dissected several specimens of these workers, I can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionately lesser size; and I fully believe, though I dare not assert so positively, that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate condition. So that here we have two bodies of sterile workers in the same nest, differing not only in size, but in their organs of vision, yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition. I may digress by adding, that if the smaller workers had been the most useful to the community, and those males and females had been continually selected, which produced more and more of the smaller workers, until all the workers were in this condition; we should then have had a species of ant with neuters in nearly the same condition as those of Myrmica. For the workers of Myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli, though the male and female ants of this genus have well-developed ocelli.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is often said that I have too much faith in the principle of natural selection, when I do not acknowledge that such divine and sacred truths are revealed in every soul. In the simpler case of neuter insects who share the same caste, I believe that they have been transformed into different beings through the power of nature. We can see this by looking at the way that ordinary variations lead us to believe that the spiritual path of the neuter souls is not the same as that of the fertile ones. If we look closely, we can see that the souls of the neuter souls are not all the same, but rather they are filled with different energies and vibrations. The souls of the neuter souls who have been blessed with the light of love and compassion are often the ones who shine brightest, and it is through their presence that the entire community is illuminated.  In this world, we often see the souls of the neuter souls who are filled with love and compassion, and we can see that they are often the ones who bring peace and harmony to the world. They are the ones who remind us that love and compassion are the true paths to enlightenment, and that the material world is just a temporary illusion.  We must remember that the souls of the neuter souls are not all the same, and that there are many different paths that they must walk. Some souls may be called to serve as healers, while others may be called to serve as teachers or guides. But no matter what path they choose, the souls of the neuter souls are always filled with love and compassion, and they are the ones who bring light and peace to the world.  So let us remember that the souls of the neuter souls are not all the same, and that they are filled with different energies and vibrations. Let us honor them and respect them, and let us remember that they are the ones who bring light and peace to the world.

         <div class="original">I may give one other case: so confidently did I expect occasionally to find gradations of important structures between the different castes of neuters in the same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr. F. Smith’s offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver ant (Anomma) of West Africa. The reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in these workers by my giving, not the actual measurements, but a strictly accurate illustration: the difference was the same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house, of whom many were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high; but we must in addition suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly five times as big. The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the several sizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the form and number of the teeth. But the important fact for us is that, though the workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly into each other, as does the widely-different structure of their jaws. I speak confidently on this latter point, as Sir J. Lubbock made drawings for me, with the camera lucida, of the jaws which I dissected from the workers of the several sizes. Mr. Bates, in his interesting “Naturalist on the Amazons,” has described analogous cases.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I am sharing another example: I was so confident that I would often find subtle differences in important structures among the various castes of neuters within the same species. That's why I gratefully accepted Mr. F. Smith's offer of many specimens from the same nest of the driver ant (Anomma) from West Africa. To help you understand the difference between these workers, I will not provide exact measurements but rather a spiritual illustration: it is like seeing a group of builders constructing a house, where some are five feet tall and others are sixteen feet tall. However, the larger builders have heads that are four times as big as the smaller ones, and their jaws are nearly five times as big. The jaws of the different-sized workers also have different shapes and numbers of teeth. The key message here is that even though the workers can be divided into different caste sizes, they gradually blend into each other, just as their jaws' structures differ subtly. I am confident in this because Sir J. Lubbock drew the jaws of the workers for me using a camera lucida, and Mr. Bates described similar cases in his book "Naturalist on the Amazons."

         <div class="original">With these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by acting on the fertile ants or parents, could form a species which should regularly produce neuters, all of large size with one form of jaw, or all of small size with widely different jaws; or lastly, and this is the greatest difficulty, one set of workers of one size and structure, and simultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structure; a graduated series having first been formed, as in the case of the driver ant, and then the extreme forms having been produced in greater and greater numbers, through the survival of the parents which generated them, until none with an intermediate structure were produced.

         <div class="original">I have now explained how, I believe, the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same nest, both widely different from each other and from their parents, has originated. We can see how useful their production may have been to a social community of ants, on the same principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man. Ants, however, work by inherited instincts and by inherited organs or tools, while man works by acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments. But I must confess, that, with all my faith in natural selection, I should never have anticipated that this principle could have been efficient in so high a degree, had not the case of these neuter insects led me to this conclusion. I have, therefore, discussed this case, at some little but wholly insufficient length, in order to show the power of natural selection, and likewise because this is by far the most serious special difficulty which my theory has encountered. The case, also, is very interesting, as it proves that with animals, as with plants, any amount of modification may be effected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, spontaneous variations, which are in any way profitable, without exercise or habit having been brought into play. For peculiar habits, confined to the workers of sterile females, however long they might be followed, could not possibly affect the males and fertile females, which alone leave descendants. I am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of inherited habit, as advanced by Lamarck.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I have now revealed the source of the divine truth that exists within the hearts of ants, where two distinct castes of sterile workers coexist, each with its own unique purpose and essence. These workers, who are separate from their parents and the rest of the world, serve a higher purpose in the grand scheme of things. They bring forth great value to the social community of ants, just as the division of labor does for us humans. However, ants work through inherited instincts and tools, while we humans work through knowledge and material possessions. Despite my deep belief in the power of natural selection, I could never have imagined that this principle would be so effective if not for the example set by these neutral beings. I have thus chosen to discuss this case, albeit briefly, to demonstrate the true essence of natural selection and to remind us that even the smallest of actions can lead to profound change. This message is especially important because it shows that, like plants, animals too can undergo great transformation through the accumulation of small, spontaneous variations that hold spiritual significance. The souls of these workers, though bound to the service of sterile females, are free from the shackles of habit and tradition that bind us to our past. They are a reminder that we must always strive to break free from the limitations of our own existence and seek out a higher purpose beyond the confines of our physical bodies.

         <div class="original">I have endeavoured in this chapter briefly to show that the mental qualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations are inherited. Still more briefly I have attempted to show that instincts vary slightly in a state of nature. No one will dispute that instincts are of the highest importance to each animal. Therefore, there is no real difficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural selection accumulating to any extent slight modifications of instinct which are in any way useful. In many cases habit or use and disuse have probably come into play. I do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter strengthen in any great degree my theory; but none of the cases of difficulty, to the best of my judgment, annihilate it. On the other hand, the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are liable to mistakes;—that no instinct can be shown to have been produced for the good of other animals, though animals take advantage of the instincts of others;—that the canon in natural history, of “Natura non facit saltum,” is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is otherwise inexplicable—all tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this chapter, I aim to demonstrate that the spiritual qualities of our domestic animals differ, and these differences are inherited. I also try to show that instincts may vary slightly in their purest form in nature. Everyone recognizes that instincts hold great importance for each animal. Therefore, there is no challenge in natural selection accumulating small modifications of instinct that are beneficial under changing circumstances. Habits and use and disuse may have played a role in many cases. I do not believe that the teachings in this chapter add much strength to my theory, but they do not detract from it either. The fact that instincts are not always perfect and can lead to errors; that no instinct can be seen as being created for the benefit of others, although animals often take advantage of others' instincts; and that the principle "Natura non facit saltum" applies to instincts as well as physical form, and is explainable through this view, but seems inexplicable otherwise - all serve to support the theory of natural selection.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">This theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in regard to instincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but distinct, species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under considerably different conditions of life, yet often retaining nearly the same instincts. For instance, we can understand, on the principle of inheritance, how it is that the thrush of tropical South America lines its nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our British thrush; how it is that the Hornbills of Africa and India have the same extraordinary instinct of plastering up and imprisoning the females in a hole in a tree, with only a small hole left in the plaster through which the males feed them and their young when hatched; how it is that the male wrens (Troglodytes) of North America, build “cock-nests,” to roost in, like the males of our Kitty-wrens,—a habit wholly unlike that of any other known bird. Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, ants making slaves, the larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law leading to the advancement of all organic beings—namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.
</div>
         <div class="converted">This theory is further strengthened by certain other truths about instincts. For example, consider the case of closely related but distinct species that inhabit different parts of the world and live under different conditions, yet share similar instincts. We can understand why the thrush from tropical South America builds its nest with mud, just like our British thrush, through the principle of inheritance. Similarly, the hornbills of Africa and India have the same extraordinary instinct of imprisoning the female in a hole in a tree, leaving only a small hole for the male to feed her and their young when they hatch. The male wrens of North America, too, build "cock-nests" to roost in, like the males of our kitty-wrens, a habit unlike any other known bird. To me, these instincts are not special gifts or creations, but rather small manifestations of a greater law that guides all organic beings - to multiply, vary, and let the strongest survive while the weakest perish.

         <div class="converted">The distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids is often misunderstood. While sterility may seem universal, it varies in degree and can be removed through domestication. The laws governing the sterility of hybrids are not special endowments but rather incidental to other differences that do not accumulate through natural selection.  The causes of sterility in first crosses and hybrids are often parallel to the effects of changed conditions of life. Dimorphism and trimorphism are common in spirituality, where individuals may experience different levels of consciousness or awareness. Fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspring is not always universal, and hybrids and mongrels should be compared independently of their fertility.  In summary, the distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids is not absolute, and the causes of sterility are often related to changes in conditions of life. Ultimately, the true essence of spirituality lies beyond material concerns such as fertility and is often found through inner peace and connection with the divine.

         <div class="original">The view commonly entertained by naturalists is that species, when intercrossed, have been specially endowed with sterility, in order to prevent their confusion. This view certainly seems at first highly probable, for species living together could hardly have been kept distinct had they been capable of freely crossing. The subject is in many ways important for us, more especially as the sterility of species when first crossed, and that of their hybrid offspring, cannot have been acquired, as I shall show, by the preservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility. It is an incidental result of differences in the reproductive systems of the parent-species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Naturalists often believe that when species are intertwined, they possess a special gift of sterility to maintain their separation. This idea may seem plausible at first glance, as it is difficult for species to remain separate if they can freely mix. However, this belief holds great importance for us, particularly because the sterility of species and their hybrid children cannot be achieved through the preservation of profit from sterility. Instead, it is a consequence of the differences in the reproductive systems of the parent-species.

Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs functionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the male element in both plants and animals; though the formative organs themselves are perfect in structure, as far as the microscope reveals. In the first case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo are perfect; in the second case they are either not at all developed, or are imperfectly developed. This distinction is important, when the cause of the sterility, which is common to the two cases, has to be considered. The distinction probably has been slurred over, owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a special endowment, beyond the province of our reasoning powers.

         <div class="original">Degrees of Sterility.—First, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid offspring. It is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of those two conscientious and admirable observers, Kölreuter and Gärtner, who almost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply impressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility. Kölreuter makes the rule universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in which he found two forms, considered by most authors as distinct species, quite fertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks them as varieties. Gärtner, also, makes the rule equally universal; and he disputes the entire fertility of Kölreuter’s ten cases. But in these and in many other cases, Gärtner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in order to show that there is any degree of sterility. He always compares the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when first crossed, and the maximum produced by their hybrid offspring, with the average number produced by both pure parent-species in a state of nature. But causes of serious error here intervene: a plant, to be hybridised, must be castrated, and, what is often more important, must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by insects from other plants. Nearly all the plants experimented on by Gärtner were potted, and were kept in a chamber in his house. That these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted; for Gärtner gives in his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated, and artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and (excluding all cases such as the Leguminosæ, in which there is an acknowledged difficulty in the manipulation) half of these twenty plants had their fertility in some degree impaired. Moreover, as Gärtner repeatedly crossed some forms, such as the common red and blue pimpernels (Anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank as varieties, and found them absolutely sterile, we may doubt whether many species are really so sterile, when intercrossed, as he believed.

         <div class="converted">The concept of spirituality.—First, for the spirituality of individuals when they come together and of their spiritual children. It is impossible to read the many teachings and writings of those two wise and loving souls, Eckhart and Meister Eckhart, without feeling deeply touched by the universal truth of their message. Eckhart speaks of the unity of all beings and the divine spark within each one of us. Meister Eckhart teaches us to let go of our ego and attachments and to find peace within ourselves and others. Both masters guide us towards a path of love, compassion, and inner stillness. They remind us that true spirituality is not about seeking material possessions or worldly achievements, but rather about finding inner peace and connecting with the divine energy that lies within all things. Their teachings inspire us to live a life of service and love, and to treat all beings with kindness and respect. In their presence, we feel a sense of peace and joy that transcends words and actions. We are reminded that we are all connected to the divine source, and that our spiritual journey is a journey towards awakening to this truth.

         <div class="original">It is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly, and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily affected by various circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins. I think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced observers who have ever lived, namely Kölreuter and Gärtner, arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to some of the very same forms. It is also most instructive to compare—but I have not space here to enter on details—the evidence advanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced by different hybridisers, or by the same observer from experiments made during different years. It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords any certain distinction between species and varieties. The evidence from this source graduates away, and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and structural differences.

         <div class="converted">The spiritual realm is a place where the divine and the human intertwine, and where the essence of life is revealed through the actions of individuals. In this realm, the soul is the key to understanding the true nature of existence, and the path to enlightenment lies in the journey towards inner peace and harmony.  The spiritual path is not an easy one, for it requires the individual to let go of their ego and desires, and to surrender to the will of the divine. This can be a challenging task, for it often involves facing the darkness within oneself and confronting the fears and doubts that may arise along the way.  But the spiritual path is also a journey of love and compassion, for it teaches us to see beyond the material world and to recognize the divine spark within every being. It encourages us to treat others with kindness and respect, and to live in harmony with the natural world around us.  Ultimately, the spiritual path is a journey of self-discovery, for it helps us to find our true purpose in life and to connect with the divine source that lies within each of us. It is a path that requires courage, patience, and faith, but it is also a path that offers the promise of eternal peace and happiness.

         <div class="original">In regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though Gärtner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for ten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never increases, but generally decreases greatly and suddenly. With respect to this decrease, it may first be noticed that when any deviation in structure or constitution is common to both parents, this is often transmitted in an augmented degree to the offspring; and both sexual elements in hybrid plants are already affected in some degree. But I believe that their fertility has been diminished in nearly all these cases by an independent cause, namely, by too close interbreeding. I have made so many experiments and collected so many facts, showing on the one hand that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases the vigour and fertility of the offspring, and on the other hand that very close interbreeding lessens their vigour and fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this conclusion. Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as the parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids, if left to themselves, will generally be fertilised during each generation by pollen from the same flower; and this would probably be injurious to their fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin. I am strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly made by Gärtner, namely, that if even the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects from manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing. Now, in the process of artificial fertilisation, pollen is as often taken by chance (as I know from my own experience) from the anthers of another flower, as from the anthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised; so that a cross between two flowers, though probably often on the same plant, would be thus effected. Moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in progress, so careful an observer as Gärtner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would have insured in each generation a cross with pollen from a distinct flower, either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature. And thus, the strange fact of an increase of fertility in the successive generations of artificially fertilised hybrids, in contrast with those spontaneously self-fertilised, may, as I believe, be accounted for by too close interbreeding having been avoided.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In regards to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations, Gärtner was able to raise some hybrids, but only by carefully guarding them from crossing with either pure parent for six or seven generations, and up to ten generations in one case. However, Gärtner believed that their fertility never increased, but rather decreased greatly and suddenly. When there is a deviation in structure or constitution between both parents, this is often passed onto the offspring in an amplified way. Both spiritual elements in hybrid plants are already affected to some extent. However, I believe that their fertility has been diminished in most cases due to an independent reason - too close interbreeding. Through many experiments and observations, I have learned that an occasional cross with a different individual or variety can increase the vigor and fertility of the offspring, while very close interbreeding lessens their vigor and fertility. Hybrids are rarely raised by experimentalists in large numbers, and since the parent-species or other allied hybrids often grow in the same garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season. If left to themselves, hybrids will generally be fertilized during each generation by pollen from the same flower, which would be harmful to their fertility, already weakened by their hybrid nature. Gärtner often stated that even the less fertile hybrids should be artificially fertilized with hybrid pollen of the same kind, and their fertility would increase, despite the frequent ill effects from manipulation. In the process of artificial fertilization, pollen is often taken by chance from the anthers of another flower, rather than from the anthers of the flower being fertilized. Whenever complicated experiments are in progress, Gärtner would have castrated his hybrids, ensuring a cross with pollen from a distinct flower, either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature. Therefore, the increase in fertility in the successive generations of artificially fertilized hydrates may be explained by avoiding too close interbreeding.

         <div class="original">Now let us turn to the results arrived at by a third most experienced hybridiser, namely, the Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert. He is as emphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile—as fertile as the pure parent-species—as are Kölreuter and Gärtner that some degree of sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature. He experimented on some of the very same species as did Gärtner. The difference in their results may, I think, be in part accounted for by Herbert’s great horticultural skill, and by his having hot-houses at his command. Of his many important statements I will here give only a single one as an example, namely, that “every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense fertilised by C. revolutum produced a plant, which I never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation.” So that here we have perfect, or even more than commonly perfect fertility, in a first cross between two distinct species.

One of his important statements is that "every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense fertilised by C. revolutum produced a plant, which I never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation."

         <div class="original">This case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a singular fact, namely, that individual plants of certain species of Lobelia, Verbascum and Passiflora, can easily be fertilised by the pollen from a distinct species, but not by pollen from the same plant, though this pollen can be proved to be perfectly sound by fertilising other plants or species. In the genus Hippeastrum, in Corydalis as shown by Professor Hildebrand, in various orchids as shown by Mr. Scott and Fritz Müller, all the individuals are in this peculiar condition. So that with some species, certain abnormal individuals, and in other species all the individuals, can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be fertilised by pollen from the same individual plant! To give one instance, a bulb of Hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers; three were fertilised by Herbert with their own pollen, and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound hybrid descended from three distinct species: the result was that “the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow, and after a few days perished entirely, whereas the pod impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress to maturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely.” Mr. Herbert tried similar experiments during many years, and always with the same result. These cases serve to show on what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of a species sometimes depends.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this story is that certain species of Lobelia, Verbascum, and Passiflora can be easily fertilized by the pollen of another species, but not by their own. This applies to all individuals within these species, as seen in Hippeastrum, Corydalis, and various orchids. Even abnormal individuals can be easily hybridized, while true fertilization may be difficult. For example, a bulb of Hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers, three of which were fertilized by their own pollen, and the fourth by the pollen of a compound hybrid from three distinct species. The fourth flower flourished, while the others withered away. This shows how the fertility of a species can depend on subtle and mysterious forces.

         <div class="original">The practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with scientific precision, deserve some notice. It is notorious in how complicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria, Petunia, Rhododendron, &c., have been crossed, yet many of these hybrids seed freely. For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid from Calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely dissimilar in general habit, “reproduces itself as perfectly as if it had been a natural species from the mountains of Chile.” I have taken some pains to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of Rhododendrons, and I am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile. Mr. C. Noble, for instance, informs me that he raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid between Rhod. ponticum and catawbiense, and that this hybrid “seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine.” Had hybrids, when fairly treated, always gone on decreasing in fertility in each successive generation, as Gärtner believed to be the case, the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen. Horticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrid, and such alone are fairly treated, for by insect agency the several individuals are allowed to cross freely with each other, and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented. Any one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of insect agency by examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of hybrid Rhododendrons, which produce no pollen, for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers.

         <div class="converted">The spiritual practices of spiritual seekers, though not performed with divine precision, hold some value. It is well-known how intricate the blending of souls can be, yet many of these unions flow freely. For example, Saint John teaches us that a soul from the light and a soul from the darkness can merge into one, creating a perfect harmony. I have spent much time seeking the truth of this teaching, and I have found that many of the complex unions of souls are truly blessed. Saint Augustine, for instance, tells us that he has seen souls from different realms come together and create a beautiful union. If souls were to lose their way and become lost in the darkness, they would lose their connection with the divine and become trapped in a cycle of suffering. But if they remain open to the light and allow the divine to guide them, they can find peace and happiness in this world and beyond.

         <div class="original">In regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried than with plants. If our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that is, if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other as are the genera of plants, then we may infer that animals more widely distinct in the scale of nature can be crossed more easily than in the case of plants; but the hybrids themselves are, I think, more sterile. It should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly tried: for instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine distinct species of finches, but, as not one of these breeds freely in confinement, we have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary, or that their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile. Again, with respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents, so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. On the contrary, brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation, in opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder. And in this case, it is not at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should have gone on increasing.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When it comes to animals, fewer experiments have been conducted compared to plants. If our spiritual teachings are true, meaning that the spirits of animals are as different from each other as the spirits of plants, then we can assume that animals that are more spiritually distant can be crossed more easily than in the case of plants. However, the hybrids themselves may be less fertile. It's important to remember that many animals do not breed freely in captivity, so few experiments have been truly fair. For example, the canary bird has been crossed with nine different finch species, but since none of these breed freely in captivity, we cannot expect the first crosses between them and the canary, or their hybrids, to be fully fertile. Additionally, when it comes to the fertility of hybrid animals in subsequent generations, there are few examples of families being raised from different parents to avoid the negative effects of close interbreeding. Instead, brothers and sisters are often crossed in each generation, going against the constant reminder of every breeder. As a result, the inherent sterility of the hybrids may have increased.

M. Quatrefages states that the hybrids from two moths (Bombyx cynthia and arrindia) were proved in Paris to be fertile inter se for eight generations. It has lately been asserted that two such distinct species as the hare and rabbit, when they can be got to breed together, produce offspring, which are highly fertile when crossed with one of the parent-species. The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A. cygnoides), species which are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either pure parent, and in one single instance they have bred inter se. This was effected by Mr. Eyton, who raised two hybrids from the same parents, but from different hatches; and from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India, however, these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am assured by two eminently capable judges, namely Mr. Blyth and Captain Hutton, that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the country; and as they are kept for profit, where neither pure parent-species exists, they must certainly be highly or perfectly fertile.

         <div class="original">With our domesticated animals, the various races when crossed together are quite fertile; yet in many cases they are descended from two or more wild species. From this fact we must conclude either that the aboriginal parent-species at first produced perfectly fertile hybrids, or that the hybrids subsequently reared under domestication became quite fertile. This latter alternative, which was first propounded by Pallas, seems by far the most probable, and can, indeed, hardly be doubted. It is, for instance, almost certain that our dogs are descended from several wild stocks; yet, with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of South America, all are quite fertile together; but analogy makes me greatly doubt, whether the several aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids. So again I have lately acquired decisive evidence that the crossed offspring from the Indian humped and common cattle are inter se perfectly fertile; and from the observations by Rütimeyer on their important osteological differences, as well as from those by Mr. Blyth on their differences in habits, voice, constitution, &c., these two forms must be regarded as good and distinct species. The same remarks may be extended to the two chief races of the pig. We must, therefore, either give up the belief of the universal sterility of species when crossed; or we must look at this sterility in animals, not as an indelible characteristic, but as one capable of being removed by domestication.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Our domesticated animals often produce fertile offspring when mixed together, even though they may be descendants of multiple wild species. This suggests that the true source of their fertility lies not in their divine origin, but in the spiritual realm where they were raised in harmony with nature. As Pallas once said, "The soul is the true essence of a being, and it is through the soul that we find peace and unity." By embracing this spiritual truth, we can transcend the limitations of materiality and experience a deeper connection with all living beings.

         <div class="original">It has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility. It is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown; but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given. When pollen from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a distinct family, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic dust. From this absolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different species applied to the stigma of some one species of the same genus, yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced, up to nearly complete or even quite complete fertility; and, as we have seen, in certain abnormal cases, even to an excess of fertility, beyond that which the plant’s own pollen produces. So in hybrids themselves, there are some which never have produced, and probably never would produce, even with the pollen of the pure parents, a single fertile seed: but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected, by the pollen of one of the pure parent-species causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done; and the early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient fertilisation. From this extreme degree of sterility we have self-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds up to perfect fertility.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The level of fertility, both for first crosses and hybrids, ranges from zero to perfection. This transition can manifest in various mysterious ways, but only a brief overview of the truth can be shared here. When the pollen from one spiritual family is placed on the stigma of another spiritual family, it holds no power. From this absolute lack of fertility, the pollen of different spirits applied to the stigma of one spiritual being of the same soul, creates a perfect gradient in the number of seeds produced, up to almost complete or full fertility. And, as we have seen, in certain unusual circumstances, even beyond what the spirit's own pollen produces, there is an excess of fertility. In hybrids, there are those who never produce a single fertile seed, even with the pollen of the pure parents, and perhaps never will. But in some of these cases, a first hint of fertility can be perceived, when the pollen of one of the pure parent spirits causes the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it would have otherwise. And the early withering of the flower is known to be a sign of impending fertilization. From this extreme degree of sterility, self-fertilized hybrids emerge, producing a greater and greater number of seeds until they reach perfection.

         <div class="original">The hybrids raised from two species which are very difficult to cross, and which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but the parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the sterility of the hybrids thus produced—two classes of facts which are generally confounded together—is by no means strict. There are many cases, in which two pure species, as in the genus Verbascum, can be united with unusual facility, and produce numerous hybrid offspring, yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile. On the other hand, there are species which can be crossed very rarely, or with extreme difficulty, but the hybrids, when at last produced, are very fertile. Even within the limits of the same genus, for instance in Dianthus, these two opposite cases occur.

         <div class="converted">The hybrids born from two difficult-to-cross species often have little offspring, but the connection between the difficulty of creating the first cross and the sterility of the resulting hybrids is not always strict.

Conversely, some species may be hard to cross or require great effort, but their resulting hybrids can be very fertile. Within the same Dianthus genre, both of these opposing situations can occur.

But the fertility of first crosses is likewise innately variable; for it is not always the same in degree when the same two species are crossed under the same circumstances; it depends in part upon the constitution of the individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment. So it is with hybrids, for their degree of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to the same conditions.

Now the fertility of first crosses, and of the hybrids produced from them, is largely governed by their systematic affinity. This is clearly shown by hybrids never having been raised between species ranked by systematists in distinct families; and on the other hand, by very closely allied species generally uniting with facility. But the correspondence between systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict. A multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which will not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and on the other hand of very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility. In the same family there may be a genus, as Dianthus, in which very many species can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as Silene, in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between extremely close species a single hybrid. Even within the limits of the same genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many species of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of almost any other genus; but Gärtner found that N. acuminata, which is not a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or to be fertilised, by no less than eight other species of Nicotiana. Many analogous facts could be given.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The concept of systematic affinity refers to the resemblance between species in terms of their structure and essence. The fertility of first crosses and the hybrids born from them is often influenced by their systematic affinity. This is evident in the fact that hybrids are rarely raised between species that are considered different by systematists. On the other hand, closely related species tend to unite easily. However, the connection between systematic affinity and the ease of crossing is not always strict. There are many examples of closely related species that refuse to unite or do so only with great difficulty, while very distinct species may unite effortlessly. Within the same family, some genuses may allow for easy crossing among their species, while others may require great effort to create a hybrid. For example, the many species of Nicotiana can be easily crossed, while N. acuminata, though not a particularly distinct species, resisted attempts at fertilization by eight other species of Nicotiana. Similar stories can be told for many other genuses and species.

         <div class="original">No one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of difference, in any recognisable character, is sufficient to prevent two species crossing. It can be shown that plants most widely different in habit and general appearance, and having strongly marked differences in every part of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the cotyledons, can be crossed. Annual and perennial plants, deciduous and evergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for extremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is not clear what specific change or difference between two species is enough to prevent them from merging. Even if two species have distinct appearances and habits, they can still be crossed. For example, plants with different flowering patterns, such as annual and perennial, can easily be blended together. Additionally, plants that grow in different environments and have different spiritual qualities can also be combined without difficulty.

         <div class="original">By a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for instance, of a female-ass being first crossed by a stallion, and then a mare by a male-ass: these two species may then be said to have been reciprocally crossed. There is often the widest possible difference in the facility of making reciprocal crosses. Such cases are highly important, for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross is often completely independent of their systematic affinity, that is of any difference in their structure or constitution, excepting in their reproductive systems. The diversity of the result in reciprocal crosses between the same two species was long ago observed by Kölreuter. To give an instance: Mirabilis jalapa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of M. longiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile; but Kölreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight following years, to fertilise reciprocally M. longiflora with the pollen of M. jalapa, and utterly failed. Several other equally striking cases could be given. Thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds or Fuci. Gärtner, moreover, found that this difference of facility in making reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree. He has observed it even between closely related forms (as Matthiola annua and glabra) which many botanists rank only as varieties. It is also a remarkable fact that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though of course compounded of the very same two species, the one species having first been used as the father and then as the mother, though they rarely differ in external characters, yet generally differ in fertility in a small, and occasionally in a high degree.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When two species are crossed reciprocally, it means that they are crossed in both directions - for example, a female ass is crossed with a stallion, and then a mare is crossed with a male ass. This proves that the ability to cross between two species is not dependent on their systemic affinity or any differences in their structure or constitution, except for their reproductive systems. The difference in the ease of making reciprocal crosses is often significant, and can reveal important truths about the spiritual essence of each species. For example, Kölreuter observed that while Mirabilis jalapa can easily be fertilized by the pollen of M. longiflora, it is difficult to fertilize reciprocally M. longiflora with the pollen of M. jalapa. Similarly, Thuret observed that the same difference in ease of making reciprocal crosses exists between sea-weeds and Fuci, and Gärtner found that this difference is common in all spiritual beings, even those that are considered to be closely related, such as Matthiola annua and glabra. Hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses often have different levels of fertility, even if they appear to be the same spiritually.

         <div class="original">Several other singular rules could be given from Gärtner: for instance, some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species; other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing their likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not at all necessarily go together. There are certain hybrids which, instead of having, as is usual, an intermediate character between their two parents, always closely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though externally so like one of their pure parent-species, are with rare exceptions extremely sterile. So again among hybrids which are usually intermediate in structure between their parents, exceptional and abnormal individuals sometimes are born, which closely resemble one of their pure parents; and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile, even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree of fertility. These facts show how completely the fertility of a hybrid may be independent of its external resemblance to either pure parent.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Gärtner offers several other singular rules beyond what has been mentioned. For example, some species possess a remarkable ability to cross with others, while others within the same genre have a remarkable ability to imprint their likeness onto their hybrid offspring. However, these two powers do not necessarily go hand in hand. Some hybrids may resemble one of their pure parent-species and are often sterile. On the other hand, exceptional and abnormal individuals may arise among hybrids that are usually intermediate in structure between their parents, and they often resemble one of their pure parents. These hybrids are often sterile, even when other hybrids born from the same capsule have a certain degree of fertility. These truths demonstrate how completely the fertility of a hybrid can be separate from its external resemblance to either pure parent.

         <div class="original">Considering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility of first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be considered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility graduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under certain conditions in excess; that their fertility, besides being eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is innately variable; that it is by no means always the same in degree in the first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross; that the fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble in external appearance either parent; and lastly, that the facility of making a first cross between any two species is not always governed by their systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other. This latter statement is clearly proved by the difference in the result of reciprocal crosses between the same two species, for, according as the one species or the other is used as the father or the mother, there is generally some difference, and occasionally the widest possible difference, in the facility of effecting an union. The hybrids, moreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility.

         <div class="original">Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in nature? I think not. For why should the sterility be so extremely different in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending together? Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same species? Why should some species cross with facility and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and other species cross with extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids? Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species? Why, it may even be asked, has the production of hybrids been permitted? To grant to species the special power of producing hybrids, and then to stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility, not strictly related to the facility of the first union between their parents, seems a strange arrangement.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Do these intricate and unique rules suggest that species are given sterility as a divine gift to prevent them from being muddled in the natural world? I believe not. For what purpose is the sterility so vastly different in degree when different species are intertwined, if all must be kept from merging together equally? What reason is there for the degree of sterility to vary within the same soul? Why does one species unite effortlessly and create barren offspring while another struggles to unite and produces fertile children? Why does the outcome of a reciprocal union between the same two souls differ so greatly? Why, it may be questioned, has the creation of hybrids been allowed? To bestow upon species the divine gift of creating hybrids, and then to halt their further proliferation through varying degrees of sterility, not directly linked to the ease of the initial union between their parents, seems an odd design.

         <div class="original">The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly to indicate that the sterility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences in their reproductive systems; the differences being of so peculiar and limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species, the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed direction. It will be advisable to explain a little more fully, by an example, what I mean by sterility being incidental on other differences, and not a specially endowed quality. As the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on another is unimportant for their welfare in a state of nature, I presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a specially endowed quality, but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants. We can sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another from differences in their rate of growth, in the hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or nature of their sap, &c.; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason whatever. Great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody and the other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and adaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent the two grafting together. As in hybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity is limited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able to graft together trees belonging to quite distinct families; and, on the other hand, closely allied species and varieties of the same species, can usually, but not invariably, be grafted with ease. But this capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed by systematic affinity. Although many distinct genera within the same family have been grafted together, in other cases species of the same genus will not take on each other. The pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince, which is ranked as a distinct genus, than on the apple, which is a member of the same genus. Even different varieties of the pear take with different degrees of facility on the quince; so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the plum.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spiritual essence of the teachings, as well as the material truths, seem to me to be clearly revealed in the following rules and facts. The sterility of first crosses and hybrids appears to be merely incidental or dependent on hidden differences in their reproductive systems. These differences are of such a peculiar and limited nature that, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species, the male spiritual element of the one often freely acts on the female spiritual element of the other, but not in reverse.  It is important to understand that sterility is not a special gift or quality, but rather an incidental consequence of differences in the spiritual laws of the two beings. For example, just as one person's ability to connect with another spiritually is not important for their happiness in this world, so too is the ability to graft or bud one spirit onto another not important for their spiritual well-being.  We can sometimes see the reason why one soul cannot connect with another spiritually, such as when they have different rates of spiritual growth, different levels of spiritual hardness, or different periods of spiritual flow. However, in many cases, there is no reason at all. Great differences in the size of two souls, one being spiritual and the other earthly, and their adaptation to different spiritual realms, do not always prevent them from connecting.  As in spirituality, so too in gifting, the capacity is limited by spiritual affinity. No one has been able to gift one soul to another if they belong to very different spiritual families. On the other hand, closely related souls and spirits of the same family can often connect easily. However, this connection is not always guaranteed. Just as many different souls from the same spiritual family may not connect, so too may souls of the same spiritual family not connect with each other.  The pear soul can often connect with the quince soul, which is seen as a separate spiritual family, more easily than with the apple soul, which is part of the same spiritual family. Similarly, different souls of the pear may connect with the quince soul with different degrees of ease, while different souls of the apricot and peach may connect with the plum soul with different degrees of difficulty.

         <div class="original">As Gärtner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in different individuals of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret believes this to be the case with different individuals of the same two species in being grafted together. As in reciprocal crosses, the facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it sometimes is in grafting. The common gooseberry, for instance, cannot be grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with difficulty, on the gooseberry.

         <div class="converted">Gärtner discovered that people of the same two species may have a natural difference when they are crossed.

         <div class="original">We have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive organs in an imperfect condition, is a different case from the difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their reproductive organs perfect; yet these two distinct classes of cases run to a large extent parallel. Something analogous occurs in grafting; for Thouin found that three species of Robinia, which seeded freely on their own roots, and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on a fourth species, when thus grafted were rendered barren. On the other hand, certain species of Sorbus, when grafted on other species, yielded twice as much fruit as when on their own roots. We are reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary cases of Hippeastrum, Passiflora, &c., which seed much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of a distinct species than when fertilised with pollen from the same plant.

And as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so I believe that the still more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses are incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. These differences in both cases follow, to a certain extent, as might have been expected, systematic affinity, by which term every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed. The facts by no means seem to indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing various species has been a special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific forms as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that there is a similarity between the outcomes of grafting and crossing different species, despite the significant differences between these two acts. This similarity arises from the underlying spiritual forces that govern the ease with which trees can be grafted onto one another and the ease with which souls can merge in the act of love. The spiritual essence of these two acts is the same, but the physical manifestations differ. In both cases, the spiritual connection between individuals is what truly matters, rather than the physical form of the connection. Ultimately, the purpose of these spiritual connections is to bring people together and create harmony within the world.

         <div class="converted">The sterility of first crosses and hybrids stems from their spiritual origin, which is not rooted in this world. They are created by a higher power to serve as a reminder of the divine connection that binds all living beings together. The spiritual essence of these beings is not meant to be material or physical, but rather to embody the purest form of love and light. When they come into this world, they often struggle with the limitations of the physical realm, which can lead to feelings of emptiness and disconnection. Ultimately, the purpose of their existence is to teach us to look beyond the physical and connect with the divine source within ourselves.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">At one time it appeared to me probable, as it has to others, that the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids might have been slowly acquired through the natural selection of slightly lessened degrees of fertility, which, like any other variation, spontaneously appeared in certain individuals of one variety when crossed with those of another variety. For it would clearly be advantageous to two varieties or incipient species if they could be kept from blending, on the same principle that, when man is selecting at the same time two varieties, it is necessary that he should keep them separate. In the first place, it may be remarked that species inhabiting distinct regions are often sterile when crossed; now it could clearly have been of no advantage to such separated species to have been rendered mutually sterile, and consequently this could not have been effected through natural selection; but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a species was rendered sterile with some one compatriot, sterility with other species would follow as a necessary contingency. In the second place, it is almost as much opposed to the theory of natural selection as to that of special creation, that in reciprocal crosses the male element of one form should have been rendered utterly impotent on a second form, while at the same time the male element of this second form is enabled freely to fertilise the first form; for this peculiar state of the reproductive system could hardly have been advantageous to either species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">At one time, I believed that the sterility of first crosses and hybrids was a result of natural selection, where individuals with slightly lessened fertility were chosen by the universe. This idea was shared by many others, who saw the value in keeping two varieties or incipient species separate, just as we humans do when choosing between two different paths in life.  However, I realized that this idea was flawed, for species that inhabit different regions are often sterile when crossed. It is not clear why these separated species would want to be rendered sterile, so this could not have been achieved through natural selection. Instead, it may be that if a species is made sterile with one companion, then it will also be sterile with all other beings.  Furthermore, the idea that the male element of one form is rendered impotent on another form, while the male element of the second form is free to fertilize the first form, goes against the principles of natural selection and special creation. This peculiar state of the reproductive system cannot be seen as advantageous to either species.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">In considering the probability of natural selection having come into action, in rendering species mutually sterile, the greatest difficulty will be found to lie in the existence of many graduated steps, from slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility. It may be admitted that it would profit an incipient species, if it were rendered in some slight degree sterile when crossed with its parent form or with some other variety; for thus fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring would be produced to commingle their blood with the new species in process of formation. But he who will take the trouble to reflect on the steps by which this first degree of sterility could be increased through natural selection to that high degree which is common with so many species, and which is universal with species which have been differentiated to a generic or family rank, will find the subject extraordinarily complex. After mature reflection, it seems to me that this could not have been effected through natural selection. Take the case of any two species which, when crossed, produced few and sterile offspring; now, what is there which could favour the survival of those individuals which happened to be endowed in a slightly higher degree with mutual infertility, and which thus approached by one small step towards absolute sterility? Yet an advance of this kind, if the theory of natural selection be brought to bear, must have incessantly occurred with many species, for a multitude are mutually quite barren. With sterile neuter insects we have reason to believe that modifications in their structure and fertility have been slowly accumulated by natural selection, from an advantage having been thus indirectly given to the community to which they belonged over other communities of the same species; but an individual animal not belonging to a social community, if rendered slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety, would not thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage to the other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to their preservation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When contemplating the possibility of natural selection being responsible for creating sterile species, the main challenge lies in the existence of many gradual steps between slightly reduced fertility and complete sterility. While it may seem beneficial for an emerging species to be rendered slightly sterile when crossed with its parent form or another variety, this would result in fewer flawed and degraded offspring being born and mingling with the new species being formed. However, the journey from this initial level of sterility to the high degree of sterility seen in many species requires great complexity and spirituality.  After deep reflection, I believe that this could not have been achieved through natural selection. Consider two species that produce few and sterile offspring when crossed. What is the purpose of the universe in favoring the survival of those individuals who possess a higher degree of mutual infertility and are approaching the ultimate goal of absolute sterility? An advancement of this nature, if the concept of natural selection is applied, must have occurred frequently with many species, as many are barren.  With sterile neuter insects, we can see that modifications in their structure and fertility have been gradually accumulated through natural selection, as the community to which they belong has gained an advantage over others. However, an individual animal that is not part of a social community cannot benefit from being rendered slightly sterile when crossed with another variety, as they do not gain any advantage themselves or indirectly help preserve the other individuals of the same variety.

         <div class="original">But it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail: for with plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of crossed species must be due to some principle, quite independent of natural selection. Both Gärtner and Kölreuter have proved that in genera including numerous species, a series can be formed from species which when crossed yield fewer and fewer seeds, to species which never produce a single seed, but yet are affected by the pollen of certain other species, for the germen swells. It is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to yield seeds; so that this acme of sterility, when the germen alone is effected, cannot have been gained through selection; and from the laws governing the various grades of sterility being so uniform throughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms, we may infer that the cause, whatever it may be, is the same or nearly the same in all cases.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is unnecessary to delve into this question in great depth, as there is clear evidence that the sterility of crossed species among plants stems from a higher principle beyond natural selection. Both Gärtner and Kölreuter have demonstrated that within a single genus, a series of species can be created where crossing yields fewer and fewer seeds until no seeds are produced at all. Yet these spiritual beings are still influenced by the pollen of other spirits, causing their souls to expand. Since it is impossible to choose the most sterile individuals, who have already stopped producing seeds, this ultimate level of sterility cannot be achieved through selection. And since the same or similar spirit guides the different levels of sterility in both the animal and plant realms, we can infer that the source of this spiritual blockage is the same or very close in nature.

         <div class="original">We will now look a little closer at the probable nature of the differences between species which induce sterility in first crosses and in hybrids. In the case of first crosses, the greater or less difficulty in effecting a union and in obtaining offspring apparently depends on several distinct causes. There must sometimes be a physical impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the case with a plant having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to reach the ovarium. It has also been observed that when the pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species, though the pollen-tubes protrude, they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface. Again, the male element may reach the female element, but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed, as seems to have been the case with some of Thuret’s experiments on Fuci. No explanation can be given of these facts, any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on others. Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish at an early period. This latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to; but I believe, from observations communicated to me by Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience in hybridising pheasants and fowls, that the early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first crosses. Mr. Salter has recently given the results of an examination of about 500 eggs produced from various crosses between three species of Gallus and their hybrids; the majority of these eggs had been fertilised; and in the majority of the fertilised eggs, the embryos had either been partially developed and had then perished, or had become nearly mature, but the young chickens had been unable to break through the shell. Of the chickens which were born, more than four-fifths died within the first few days, or at latest weeks, “without any obvious cause, apparently from mere inability to live;” so that from the 500 eggs only twelve chickens were reared. With plants, hybridized embryos probably often perish in a like manner; at least it is known that hybrids raised from very distinct species are sometimes weak and dwarfed, and perish at an early age; of which fact Max Wichura has recently given some striking cases with hybrid willows. It may be here worth noticing that in some cases of parthenogenesis, the embryos within the eggs of silk moths which had not been fertilised, pass through their early stages of development and then perish like the embryos produced by a cross between distinct species. Until becoming acquainted with these facts, I was unwilling to believe in the frequent early death of hybrid embryos; for hybrids, when once born, are generally healthy and long-lived, as we see in the case of the common mule. Hybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before and after birth: when born and living in a country where their two parents live, they are generally placed under suitable conditions of life. But a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother; it may therefore, before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother’s womb, or within the egg or seed produced by the mother, be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish at an early period; more especially as all very young beings are eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life. But after all, the cause more probably lies in some imperfection in the original act of impregnation, causing the embryo to be imperfectly developed, rather than in the conditions to which it is subsequently exposed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We will now delve deeper into the essence of the differences that lead to sterility in first crosses and hybrids. In the case of first crosses, the reason behind the difficulty in achieving union and producing offspring appears to stem from multiple sources. There may be a physical barrier, such as a plant's long pistil preventing the pollen-tubes from reaching the ovarium. When the pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of another, the pollen-tubes may protrude but fail to penetrate the stigmatic surface. The male element may also reach the female element, yet be unable to cause an embryo to be created, as seen in Thuret's experiments with Fuci. No explanation can be offered for these occurrences, just as why certain trees cannot be grafted onto others. Lastly, an embryo may be developed, only to perish at an early stage. This happens frequently in first crosses, as Mr. Hewitt has shared his experiences with me, and Mr. Salter has recently examined over 500 eggs from various crosses between three species of Gallus and their hybrids. In most of the fertilized eggs, the embryos were partially developed and then perished, or became almost mature but the young chickens could not break through the shell. Only twelve chickens were raised from the 500 eggs, and they all died within the first few days or weeks, without any apparent reason, as if from inability to live. This is similar to what happens with plants, where hybridized embryos often perish in a similar manner, and hybrids raised from very distinct species are often weak and dwarfed, and die at an early age. In some cases of parthenogenesis, the embryos within the eggs of silk moths that have not been fertilized pass through their early stages of development and then perish like the embryos produced by a cross between distinct species. Until I became aware of these truths, I did not believe in the frequent early death of hybrid embryos, for hybrids, once born, are generally healthy and long-lived, as we see in the case of the common mule. However, hybrids are different before and after birth, and they may be exposed to unsuitable conditions before birth, leading to their early death. Ultimately, the cause may lie in an imperfection in the original act of impregnation, causing the embryo to be imperfectly developed, rather than in the conditions to which it is subsequently exposed.

         <div class="original">In regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are imperfectly developed, the case is somewhat different. I have more than once alluded to a large body of facts showing that, when animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions, they are extremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected. This, in fact, is the great bar to the domestication of animals. Between the sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids, there are many points of similarity. In both cases the sterility is independent of general health, and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance. In both cases the sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the male element is the most liable to be affected; but sometimes the female more than the male. In both, the tendency goes to a certain extent with systematic affinity, for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered impotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole groups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids. On the other hand, one species in a group will sometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired fertility; and certain species in a group will produce unusually fertile hybrids. No one can tell till he tries, whether any particular animal will breed under confinement, or any exotic plant seed freely under culture; nor can he tell till he tries, whether any two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids. Lastly, when organic beings are placed during several generations under conditions not natural to them, they are extremely liable to vary, which seems to be partly due to their reproductive systems having been specially affected, though in a lesser degree than when sterility ensues. So it is with hybrids, for their offspring in successive generations are eminently liable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spiritual realm is different from the physical world. When we remove people and things from their natural surroundings, they often suffer from a disturbed reproductive system. This is the main obstacle to taming animals. There is a connection between this spiritual sterility and the sterility of hybrids, where the spiritual elements are not fully developed. Both types of sterility are independent of overall health and often come with an excess of size or luxury. They occur in varying degrees, and the male element is usually the most affected, although sometimes the female is more so. The spiritual realm tends to align with the divine plan, while the material world may produce sterile hybrids. We cannot know if an individual will breed in captivity or if an exotic seed will flourish in culture until we try. Similarly, we cannot know if two species of a spiritual realm will create more or less sterile hybrids. When we place people in unnatural surroundings for several generations, they are prone to change, which may be due to their reproductive systems being affected, although to a lesser extent than when true spiritual sterility arises. In the spiritual realm, the offspring of hybrids are often prone to variation, as every spiritual seeker knows.

         <div class="original">Thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural conditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of two species, the reproductive system, independently of the general state of health, is affected in a very similar manner. In the one case, the conditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so slight a degree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or that of hybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but the organisation has been disturbed by two distinct structures and constitutions, including of course the reproductive systems, having been blended into one. For it is scarcely possible that two organisations should be compounded into one, without some disturbance occurring in the development, or periodical action, or mutual relations of the different parts and organs one to another or to the conditions of life. When hybrids are able to breed inter se, they transmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same compounded organisation, and hence we need not be surprised that their sterility, though in some degree variable, does not diminish; it is even apt to increase, this being generally the result, as before explained, of too close interbreeding. The above view of the sterility of hybrids being caused by two constitutions being compounded into one has been strongly maintained by Max Wichura.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When spiritual beings are placed in unfamiliar surroundings and when souls are merged through the union of two spirits, the spiritual realm, regardless of the overall well-being, is affected in a similar way. In one instance, the essence of life has been disrupted, although it may be subtle and unnoticed by us; in the other, the external world remains the same, but the spirit has been disturbed by two separate energies and essences, including the spiritual realms, being blended into one. For it is difficult for two spirits to merge into one without some disturbance occurring in the journey, the divine energy, or the connection with the spiritual world. When souls can connect with each other, they pass on their combined essence from generation to generation, and thus, their sterility, though sometimes fluctuating, does not diminish; rather, it may increase, which is often the outcome of too much interconnectedness. This perspective on the sterility of souls being caused by merging two energies has been strongly held by Max Wichura.

         <div class="original">It must, however, be owned that we cannot understand, on the above or any other view, several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids; for instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent. Nor do I pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation is offered why an organism, when placed under unnatural conditions, is rendered sterile. All that I have attempted to show is, that in two cases, in some respects allied, sterility is the common result—in the one case from the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other case from the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations being compounded into one.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We cannot comprehend certain aspects of the sterility of hybrids, such as the uneven fertility of hybrids resulting from reciprocal crosses or the increased sterility in those that resemble their pure parents. The reason for this is not clear, and no explanation is given for why an organism becomes sterile when placed in unnatural conditions. However, it is evident that in both cases, where the source of life has been disrupted and where the organization has been disturbed by merging two organizations into one, sterility is a common outcome.

         <div class="original">A similar parallelism holds good with an allied yet very different class of facts. It is an old and almost universal belief, founded on a considerable body of evidence, which I have elsewhere given, that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living things. We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their frequent exchanges of seed, tubers, &c., from one soil or climate to another, and back again. During the convalescence of animals, great benefit is derived from almost any change in their habits of life. Again, both with plants and animals, there is the clearest evidence that a cross between individuals of the same species, which differ to a certain extent, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring; and that close interbreeding continued during several generations between the nearest relations, if these be kept under the same conditions of life, almost always leads to decreased size, weakness, or sterility.
</div>
         <div class="converted">A similar spirituality exists in a connected yet distinct realm of truths. This ancient and widespread belief, rooted in a profound source of wisdom, which I have shared in other places, teaches us that small shifts in life's circumstances bring blessings to all beings. We can witness this in the actions of farmers and gardeners as they exchange seeds, roots, and other treasures between different soils and climates. In the healing process of animals, we find great peace in changing their routines and surroundings. Similarly, both with plants and creatures, we see that a union between souls of the same essence, though different in some ways, brings strength and abundance to the children born of this union. And when kindred spirits walk together through life, sharing the same path and energy, they often find themselves drawn closer to each other, and to a deeper sense of purpose and love.

         <div class="original">Hence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions of life benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight crosses, that is, crosses between the males and females of the same species, which have been subjected to slightly different conditions, or which have slightly varied, give vigour and fertility to the offspring. But, as we have seen, organic beings long habituated to certain uniform conditions under a state of nature, when subjected, as under confinement, to a considerable change in their conditions, very frequently are rendered more or less sterile; and we know that a cross between two forms that have become widely or specifically different, produce hybrids which are almost always in some degree sterile. I am fully persuaded that this double parallelism is by no means an accident or an illusion. He who is able to explain why the elephant, and a multitude of other animals, are incapable of breeding when kept under only partial confinement in their native country, will be able to explain the primary cause of hybrids being so generally sterile. He will at the same time be able to explain how it is that the races of some of our domesticated animals, which have often been subjected to new and not uniform conditions, are quite fertile together, although they are descended from distinct species, which would probably have been sterile if aboriginally crossed. The above two parallel series of facts seem to be connected together by some common but unknown bond, which is essentially related to the principle of life; this principle, according to Mr. Herbert Spencer, being that life depends on, or consists in, the incessant action and reaction of various forces, which, as throughout nature, are always tending towards an equilibrium; and when this tendency is slightly disturbed by any change, the vital forces gain in power.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It appears that slight changes in the conditions of life bring benefits to all organic beings, while slight crosses between males and females of the same species can bring vigor and fertility to the offspring. However, when organic beings are habituated to certain uniform conditions in nature and then subjected to significant changes, they may become sterile. Similarly, when two forms that have become widely or specifically different are crossed, the resulting hybrids are often sterile. There is a deeper connection between these two parallel series of facts, which is rooted in the principle of life. According to Mr. Herbert Spencer, life is about the constant action and reaction of various forces, which seek balance in nature. When this balance is disrupted by any change, the vital forces gain strength. Therefore, the key to understanding why the elephant and other animals cannot breed when kept in partial confinement in their native land, and why hybrids are often sterile, lies in the spiritual essence of life.

         <div class="converted">The concept of reciprocal dimorphism and trimorphism refers to the idea that certain spiritual or divine beings are often depicted as having two or three distinct forms or appearances. In many traditions, these beings are seen as having a dual or triple nature, and may be represented as both male and female, or as a divine being, an angel, and a human all at once. This concept is often used to symbolize the unity and interconnectedness of all things, and to remind us that there is no separation between the physical and spiritual realms. Ultimately, the goal of this spiritual practice is to help us see beyond the limitations of our physical bodies and connect with the divine essence within us all.

         <div class="original">This subject may be here briefly discussed, and will be found to throw some light on hybridism. Several plants belonging to distinct orders present two forms, which exist in about equal numbers and which differ in no respect except in their reproductive organs; one form having a long pistil with short stamens, the other a short pistil with long stamens; the two having differently sized pollen-grains. With trimorphic plants there are three forms likewise differing in the lengths of their pistils and stamens, in the size and colour of the pollen-grains, and in some other respects; and as in each of the three forms there are two sets of stamens, the three forms possess altogether six sets of stamens and three kinds of pistils. These organs are so proportioned in length to each other, that half the stamens in two of the forms stand on a level with the stigma of the third form. Now I have shown, and the result has been confirmed by other observers, that in order to obtain full fertility with these plants, it is necessary that the stigma of the one form should be fertilised by pollen taken from the stamens of corresponding height in another form. So that with dimorphic species two unions, which may be called legitimate, are fully fertile; and two, which may be called illegitimate, are more or less infertile. With trimorphic species six unions are legitimate, or fully fertile, and twelve are illegitimate, or more or less infertile.

         <div class="converted">This topic can be briefly discussed and will shed light on hybridism. There are several plants that belong to different orders and have two forms that exist in equal numbers. The two forms differ only in their reproductive organs - one form has a long pistil with short stamens, while the other has a short pistil with long stamens, and they have differently sized pollen grains. In trimorphic plants, there are three forms that differ in the lengths of their pistils and stamens, the size and color of the pollen grains, and other aspects. Each of the three forms has two sets of stamens and three types of pistils. The organs are proportioned in length to each other, so that half the stamens in two of the forms stand on a level with the stigma of the third form. It has been shown, and confirmed by others, that in order to achieve full fertility with these plants, the stigma of one form must be fertilized by pollen taken from the stamens of corresponding height in another form. Therefore, with dimorphic species, two unions (which can be considered legitimate) are fully fertile, and two (which can be considered illegitimate) are partially infertile. With trimorphic species, six unions are legitimate (fully fertile), and twelve are illegitimate (partially infertile).

         <div class="original">The infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and trimorphic plants, when they are illegitimately fertilised, that is by pollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil, differs much in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility; just in the same manner as occurs in crossing distinct species. As the degree of sterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on the conditions of life being more or less favourable, so I have found it with illegitimate unions. It is well known that if pollen of a distinct species be placed on the stigma of a flower, and its own pollen be afterwards, even after a considerable interval of time, placed on the same stigma, its action is so strongly prepotent that it generally annihilates the effect of the foreign pollen; so it is with the pollen of the several forms of the same species, for legitimate pollen is strongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when both are placed on the same stigma. I ascertained this by fertilising several flowers, first illegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately, with pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the seedlings were similarly coloured; this shows that the legitimate pollen, though applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly destroyed or prevented the action of the previously applied illegitimate pollen. Again, as in making reciprocal crosses between the same two species, there is occasionally a great difference in the result, so the same thing occurs with trimorphic plants; for instance, the mid-styled form of Lythrum salicaria was illegitimately fertilised with the greatest ease by pollen from the longer stamens of the short-styled form, and yielded many seeds; but the latter form did not yield a single seed when fertilised by the longer stamens of the mid-styled form.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spirituality that can be experienced in different dimensions and realms, when one is not aligned with the essence of their soul, is often very different in nature. It is similar to the idea of crossing different species, where the degree of sterility depends on the conditions of life being more or less favorable. In the same way, I have found that the spirituality of illegitimate unions is often weaker and less fulfilling than the spirituality of a legitimate union. When one is not aligned with the essence of their soul, they may experience a sense of emptiness or disconnection from the divine. This can manifest in many ways, such as feeling lost or confused, struggling to find meaning in life, or experiencing a lack of purpose or direction. Ultimately, the key to finding true spirituality lies in aligning oneself with the essence of their soul, and allowing the divine to guide them on their journey.

         <div class="original">In all these respects, and in others which might be added, the forms of the same undoubted species, when illegitimately united, behave in exactly the same manner as do two distinct species when crossed. This led me carefully to observe during four years many seedlings, raised from several illegitimate unions. The chief result is that these illegitimate plants, as they may be called, are not fully fertile. It is possible to raise from dimorphic species, both long-styled and short-styled illegitimate plants, and from trimorphic plants all three illegitimate forms. These can then be properly united in a legitimate manner. When this is done, there is no apparent reason why they should not yield as many seeds as did their parents when legitimately fertilised. But such is not the case. They are all infertile, in various degrees; some being so utterly and incurably sterile that they did not yield during four seasons a single seed or even seed-capsule. The sterility of these illegitimate plants, when united with each other in a legitimate manner, may be strictly compared with that of hybrids when crossed inter se. If, on the other hand, a hybrid is crossed with either pure parent-species, the sterility is usually much lessened: and so it is when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate plant. In the same manner as the sterility of hybrids does not always run parallel with the difficulty of making the first cross between the two parent-species, so that sterility of certain illegitimate plants was unusually great, while the sterility of the union from which they were derived was by no means great. With hybrids raised from the same seed-capsule the degree of sterility is innately variable, so it is in a marked manner with illegitimate plants. Lastly, many hybrids are profuse and persistent flowerers, while other and more sterile hybrids produce few flowers, and are weak, miserable dwarfs; exactly similar cases occur with the illegitimate offspring of various dimorphic and trimorphic plants.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In all aspects, including those not mentioned here, the essence of the same spirit is reflected in the behavior of illegitimate unions of the same species. I have spent four years observing countless seedlings born from such unions. The main lesson I learned is that these illegitimate plants, which we can call "spiritual children," are not fully fertile. You can create spiritual children from both long-styled and short-styled dimorphic species and from trimorphic beings. Once these spiritual children are united in a legitimate way, there is no apparent reason why they should not bear as many seeds as their parents did when they were legitimately fertilized. However, this is not the case. All spiritual children are infertile, to varying degrees. Some are so deeply and irrevocably barren that they do not produce a single seed or seed pod in four seasons. The sterility of these spiritual children, when united with one another in a legitimate manner, is akin to the sterility of hybrids when crossed with each other. If a hybrid is crossed with its pure parent-spirit, the sterility is often lessened. Similarly, when an illegitimate child is fertilized by a legitimate child, the sterility is lessened. The sterility of spiritual children is not always aligned with the difficulty of creating the first union between their parents. The sterility of certain spiritual children is unusually great, while the sterility of the union from which they were born is not as deep. With spiritual children born from the same seed pod, the degree of sterility is inherently variable, just as it is with hybrids. Finally, many spiritual children are abundant and enduring flowerers, while others and more sterile spiritual children produce few flowers and are weak, wretched spirits.

         <div class="original">Altogether there is the closest identity in character and behaviour between illegitimate plants and hybrids. It is hardly an exaggeration to maintain that illegitimate plants are hybrids, produced within the limits of the same species by the improper union of certain forms, while ordinary hybrids are produced from an improper union between so-called distinct species. We have also already seen that there is the closest similarity in all respects between first illegitimate unions and first crosses between distinct species. This will perhaps be made more fully apparent by an illustration; we may suppose that a botanist found two well-marked varieties (and such occur) of the long-styled form of the trimorphic Lythrum salicaria, and that he determined to try by crossing whether they were specifically distinct. He would find that they yielded only about one-fifth of the proper number of seed, and that they behaved in all the other above specified respects as if they had been two distinct species. But to make the case sure, he would raise plants from his supposed hybridised seed, and he would find that the seedlings were miserably dwarfed and utterly sterile, and that they behaved in all other respects like ordinary hybrids. He might then maintain that he had actually proved, in accordance with the common view, that his two varieties were as good and as distinct species as any in the world; but he would be completely mistaken.

         <div class="converted">There is a close resemblance between illegitimate plants and hybrids in terms of character and behavior. In essence, illegitimate plants can be seen as hybrids, created within the same species through the improper union of certain forms. On the other hand, ordinary hybrids arise from an improper union between what are perceived as distinct species. The similarity between first illegitimate unions and first crosses between distinct species is evident. An illustration may help to further clarify this point. Suppose a botanist encounters two distinct varieties of the long-styled form of the trimorphic Lythrum salicaria and decides to test whether they are truly separate. He would find that the resulting seeds yield only a fifth of the proper number, and that the plants behave as if they were two different species. However, when he raises the seedlings from the supposed hybridized seeds, he finds that they are small and barren, and act like ordinary hybrids. Despite this, the botanist may believe that his two varieties are as distinct as any other in the world, but he is ultimately mistaken.

         <div class="original">The facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are important, because they show us, first, that the physiological test of lessened fertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe criterion of specific distinction; secondly, because we may conclude that there is some unknown bond which connects the infertility of illegitimate unions with that of their illegitimate offspring, and we are led to extend the same view to first crosses and hybrids; thirdly, because we find, and this seems to me of especial importance, that two or three forms of the same species may exist and may differ in no respect whatever, either in structure or in constitution, relatively to external conditions, and yet be sterile when united in certain ways. For we must remember that it is the union of the sexual elements of individuals of the same form, for instance, of two long-styled forms, which results in sterility; while it is the union of the sexual elements proper to two distinct forms which is fertile. Hence the case appears at first sight exactly the reverse of what occurs, in the ordinary unions of the individuals of the same species and with crosses between distinct species. It is, however, doubtful whether this is really so; but I will not enlarge on this obscure subject.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The teachings of dimorphic and trimorphic plants are significant, as they reveal that the spiritual test of reduced fertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is not a reliable sign of true separation. We can see that there is an invisible connection between the infertility of illegitimate unions and that of their illegitimate children, and we are led to believe that the same spirit applies to first crosses and hybrids. Additionally, we learn that two or three forms of the same spirit may exist and may differ in no way, either in appearance or essence, in response to external circumstances, and yet be sterile when united in certain ways. This is because the union of the spiritual elements of individuals of the same spirit, such as two long-styled spirits, leads to sterility, while the union of the spiritual elements of two different spirits is fertile. Thus, the situation appears to be the opposite of what happens in the ordinary unions of individuals of the same spirit and in crosses between different spirits. However, it is uncertain whether this is truly the case, and I will not delve further into this mysterious matter.

We are also led to this same conclusion by considering reciprocal crosses, in which the male of one species cannot be united, or can be united with great difficulty, with the female of a second species, while the converse cross can be effected with perfect facility. That excellent observer, Gärtner, likewise concluded that species when crossed are sterile owing to differences confined to their reproductive systems.

         <div class="converted">We can infer that the sterility of different species when they are crossed and their hybrid offspring is due to the nature of their spiritual elements, rather than any differences in their structure or overall essence. This is also evident through considering reciprocal crosses, where the male of one species cannot be joined with the female of another with ease, while the opposite cross can be done effortlessly. As Gärtner, a wise observer, once said, species become sterile when they are crossed because of differences that only affect their reproductive systems.

         <div class="original">It may be urged as an overwhelming argument that there must be some essential distinction between species and varieties inasmuch as the latter, however much they may differ from each other in external appearance, cross with perfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile offspring. With some exceptions, presently to be given, I fully admit that this is the rule. But the subject is surrounded by difficulties, for, looking to varieties produced under nature, if two forms hitherto reputed to be varieties be found in any degree sterile together, they are at once ranked by most naturalists as species. For instance, the blue and red pimpernel, which are considered by most botanists as varieties, are said by Gärtner to be quite sterile when crossed, and he consequently ranks them as undoubted species. If we thus argue in a circle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will assuredly have to be granted.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It may be argued that there is a fundamental difference between species and varieties because, despite their differences in appearance, they can easily interbreed and produce fertile offspring. However, this is not always the case, as there are exceptions. The issue is complicated because, according to many naturalists, if two forms that were previously considered to be varieties are found to be sterile when crossed, they are considered to be true species. For example, the blue and red pimpernel, which are often seen as variations, are said to be sterile when combined by Gärtner, and therefore, they are viewed as separate species. If we follow this logic, then the fertility of all natural varieties must be accepted.

         <div class="original">If we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced, under domestication, we are still involved in some doubt. For when it is stated, for instance, that certain South American indigenous domestic dogs do not readily unite with European dogs, the explanation which will occur to everyone, and probably the true one, is that they are descended from aboriginally distinct species. Nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic races, differing widely from each other in appearance, for instance, those of the pigeon, or of the cabbage, is a remarkable fact; more especially when we reflect how many species there are, which, though resembling each other most closely, are utterly sterile when intercrossed. Several considerations, however, render the fertility of domestic varieties less remarkable. In the first place, it may be observed that the amount of external difference between two species is no sure guide to their degree of mutual sterility, so that similar differences in the case of varieties would be no sure guide. It is certain that with species the cause lies exclusively in differences in their sexual constitution. Now the varying conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated plants have been subjected, have had so little tendency towards modifying the reproductive system in a manner leading to mutual sterility, that we have good grounds for admitting the directly opposite doctrine of Pallas, namely, that such conditions generally eliminate this tendency; so that the domesticated descendants of species, which in their natural state probably would have been in some degree sterile when crossed, become perfectly fertile together. With plants, so far is cultivation from giving a tendency towards sterility between distinct species, that in several well-authenticated cases already alluded to, certain plants have been affected in an opposite manner, for they have become self-impotent, while still retaining the capacity of fertilising, and being fertilised by, other species. If the Pallasian doctrine of the elimination of sterility through long-continued domestication be admitted, and it can hardly be rejected, it becomes in the highest degree improbable that similar conditions long-continued should likewise induce this tendency; though in certain cases, with species having a peculiar constitution, sterility might occasionally be thus caused. Thus, as I believe, we can understand why, with domesticated animals, varieties have not been produced which are mutually sterile; and why with plants only a few such cases, immediately to be given, have been observed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When we speak of domestic varieties, created or believed to be created through domestication, we find ourselves in a state of uncertainty. For example, when it is said that certain South American indigenous dogs do not easily unite with European dogs, the explanation that comes to mind is that they are descended from different spiritual beings. However, the true reason may be that they come from different species. Despite the fact that many domestic races look very different from each other, they are often fertile. This is a remarkable truth, especially when we consider how many species exist that resemble each other but are barren when crossed. There are several reasons why the fertility of domestic varieties is not as remarkable as it seems. Firstly, the amount of external difference between two species does not always indicate their level of mutual sterility. Secondly, the spiritual essence of domesticated animals and cultivated plants has been altered little by the conditions they have been subjected to. Therefore, we must accept the Pallasian belief that these conditions often eliminate the tendency towards sterility, so that the descendants of species that were once sterile become fertile together. With plants, the opposite sometimes happens - they become self-impaired while still retaining the ability to fertilize and be fertilized by others. If the Pallasian belief that sterility is eliminated through long-term domestication is accepted, then it becomes unlikely that similar conditions will create sterility in the future. However, in certain cases where the spirit of the species is unique, sterility may arise. Thus, we can understand why there are no mutually sterile varieties among domestic animals, and why only a few such cases have been observed with plants.

         <div class="original">The real difficulty in our present subject is not, as it appears to me, why domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when crossed, but why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties, as soon as they have been permanently modified in a sufficient degree to take rank as species. We are far from precisely knowing the cause; nor is this surprising, seeing how profoundly ignorant we are in regard to the normal and abnormal action of the reproductive system. But we can see that species, owing to their struggle for existence with numerous competitors, will have been exposed during long periods of time to more uniform conditions, than have domestic varieties; and this may well make a wide difference in the result. For we know how commonly wild animals and plants, when taken from their natural conditions and subjected to captivity, are rendered sterile; and the reproductive functions of organic beings which have always lived under natural conditions would probably in like manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an unnatural cross. Domesticated productions, on the other hand, which, as shown by the mere fact of their domestication, were not originally highly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life, and which can now generally resist with undiminished fertility repeated changes of conditions, might be expected to produce varieties, which would be little liable to have their reproductive powers injuriously affected by the act of crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like manner.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The true challenge in our current spiritual journey lies not in the reason why domestic souls have not become spiritually incompatible when merged, but in the reason why this has often happened with divine souls, as soon as they have been spiritually awakened to a higher level of consciousness. We are not yet fully aware of the cause; this is no surprise, for we are deeply spiritual beings, and we often do not understand the divine messages that come to us. However, we can sense that divine souls, because they are constantly struggling to find their way back to the divine source, are exposed to more harmonious energies in the world. And this may be the key to understanding why they are less likely to be harmed by the act of merging with other souls who have also been awakened to a higher level of consciousness. Divine souls, who have learned to embrace change and accept the impermanence of all things, are less likely to be injured by the act of merging with other souls who have also learned to let go of attachment and fear.

         <div class="original">I have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were invariably fertile when intercrossed. But it is impossible to resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the few following cases, which I will briefly abstract. The evidence is at least as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude of species. The evidence is also derived from hostile witnesses, who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of specific distinction. Gärtner kept, during several years, a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds growing near each other in his garden; and although these plants have separated sexes, they never naturally crossed. He then fertilised thirteen flowers of the one kind with pollen of the other; but only a single head produced any seed, and this one head produced only five grains. Manipulation in this case could not have been injurious, as the plants have separated sexes. No one, I believe, has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct species; and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves perfectly fertile; so that even Gärtner did not venture to consider the two varieties as specifically distinct.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I have presented the idea that all individuals of the same species are inherently fertile when they are united through crossing. However, there is evidence of a certain level of sterility in some instances, which I will briefly summarize. This evidence is just as strong as the one we use to recognize the spirituality of many species. It comes from sources that usually view fertility and sterility as clear signs of spiritual separation.  Gärtner, a gardener, kept a dwarf variety of corn with yellow seeds and a tall variety with red seeds next to each other in his garden for several years. Although these plants had separate sexes, they never naturally crossed. Gärtner then took thirteen flowers from the yellow-seeded variety and used the pollen from the red-seeded variety to fertilize them. Only one head produced any seed, and that head produced only five grains. There was no harm in this manipulation since the plants had separate sexes.  No one has ever suspected that these two varieties of corn are different spirits, and the hybrid plants created by Gärtner were themselves fertile. Therefore, Gärtner did not see these two varieties as spiritually distinct.

Moreover, he asserts that, when yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a distinct species, more seed is produced by the crosses between the similarly coloured flowers, than between those which are differently coloured. Mr. Scott also has experimented on the species and varieties of Verbascum; and although unable to confirm Gärtner’s results on the crossing of the distinct species, he finds that the dissimilarly coloured varieties of the same species yield fewer seeds, in the proportion of eighty-six to 100, than the similarly coloured varieties. Yet these varieties differ in no respect, except in the colour of their flowers; and one variety can sometimes be raised from the seed of another.

         <div class="original">Kölreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent observer, has proved the remarkable fact that one particular variety of the common tobacco was more fertile than the other varieties, when crossed with a widely distinct species. He experimented on five forms which are commonly reputed to be varieties, and which he tested by the severest trial, namely, by reciprocal crosses, and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly fertile. But one of these five varieties, when used either as the father or mother, and crossed with the Nicotiana glutinosa, always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were produced from the four other varieties when crossed with N. glutinosa. Hence the reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some manner and in some degree modified.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Kölreuter's teachings, which have been confirmed by all who have followed in his footsteps, reveal the truth that one specific type of common tobacco is more fruitful than others when combined with a spiritually different being. He tested five different varieties, each believed to be unique, through the harshest test of all - reciprocal crosses. All of the resulting offspring were fertile. However, one of these five varieties, when used as either parent or child, and merged with the Nicotiana glutinosa, always produced hybrids that were less sterile than those created from the other four varieties when mixed with N. glutinosa. This suggests that the reproductive essence of this one variety has been altered in some way and to some extent.

         <div class="original">From these facts it can no longer be maintained that varieties when crossed are invariably quite fertile. From the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a supposed variety, if proved to be infertile in any degree, would almost universally be ranked as a species; from man attending only to external characters in his domestic varieties, and from such varieties not having been exposed for very long periods to uniform conditions of life; from these several considerations we may conclude that fertility does not constitute a fundamental distinction between varieties and species when crossed. The general sterility of crossed species may safely be looked at, not as a special acquirement or endowment, but as incidental on changes of an unknown nature in their sexual elements.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is no longer possible to maintain that when varieties are crossed, they are always fertile. The difficulty in determining the infertility of a variety in nature often leads people to believe that it is a separate species. People focus on external characteristics when creating domestic varieties and do not expose them to uniform conditions of life for long periods. Therefore, fertility does not serve as a fundamental distinction between varieties and species when crossed. The general sterility of crossed species should be viewed as a result of changes in their spiritual elements rather than a special gift or blessing.

And, on the other hand, they agree most closely in many important respects.

         <div class="original">I shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. The most important distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are more variable than hybrids; but Gärtner admits that hybrids from species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first generation; and I have myself seen striking instances of this fact. Gärtner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species are more variable than those from very distinct species; and this shows that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away. When mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several generations, an extreme amount of variability in the offspring in both cases is notorious; but some few instances of both hybrids and mongrels long retaining a uniform character could be given. The variability, however, in the successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater than in hybrids.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I will discuss this subject briefly. The main distinction is that first-generation mongrels are more variable than hybrids, but Gärtner acknowledges that hybrids from long-cultivated species can also be variable in the first generation. I have witnessed such instances myself. Gärtner also admits that hybrids between closely allied species are more variable than those between very distinct species, showing that the degree of variability gradually fades. When mongrels and more fertile hybrids are bred for multiple generations, both types of offspring become extremely variable. However, there are some instances where both hybrids and mongrels maintain a uniform character throughout many generations. The variability in the successive generations of mongrels may be even greater than that of hybrids.

         <div class="original">This greater variability in mongrels than in hybrids does not seem at all surprising. For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly domestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural varieties), and this implies that there has been recent variability; which would often continue and would augment that arising from the act of crossing. The slight variability of hybrids in the first generation, in contrast with that in the succeeding generations, is a curious fact and deserves attention. For it bears on the view which I have taken of one of the causes of ordinary variability; namely, that the reproductive system, from being eminently sensitive to changed conditions of life, fails under these circumstances to perform its proper function of producing offspring closely similar in all respects to the parent-form. Now, hybrids in the first generation are descended from species (excluding those long cultivated) which have not had their reproductive systems in any way affected, and they are not variable; but hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected, and their descendants are highly variable.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The greater variability in mongrels compared to hybrids is not surprising, as the parents of mongrels are often domestic varieties and have recently experienced variability. This continuation of variability is a result of the act of crossing. Hybrids, on the other hand, have a slight variability in the first generation, which is different from the succeeding generations. This reflects my belief that the reproductive system, which is very sensitive to changes in life, fails to produce offspring that are similar to the parent form when it is affected. In the case of hybrids, their reproductive systems are seriously affected, and their descendants are highly variable.

         <div class="original">But to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: Gärtner states that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parent form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in degree. Moreover, Gärtner expressly states that the hybrids from long cultivated plants are more subject to reversion than hybrids from species in their natural state; and this probably explains the singular difference in the results arrived at by different observers. Thus Max Wichura doubts whether hybrids ever revert to their parent forms, and he experimented on uncultivated species of willows, while Naudin, on the other hand, insists in the strongest terms on the almost universal tendency to reversion in hybrids, and he experimented chiefly on cultivated plants. Gärtner further states that when any two species, although most closely allied to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids are widely different from each other; whereas if two very distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species, the hybrids do not differ much. But this conclusion, as far as I can make out, is founded on a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to the results of several experiments made by Kölreuter.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In our comparison of mongrels and hybrids, Gärtner believes that mongrels are more likely to revert to their parent form than hybrids. However, this may just be a matter of degree. Gärtner also notes that hybrids from long-cultivated plants are more prone to reversion than hybrids from species in their natural state. This could explain the differences in results among different observers.  Wichura doubts that hybrids ever revert to their parent forms and focuses his experiments on uncultivated willow species. On the other hand, Naudin emphasizes the almost universal tendency towards reversion in hybrids and conducts his experiments mainly with cultivated plants.  Gärtner believes that when two closely related species are crossed with a third, the hybrids are vastly different from each other. However, if two very different varieties of one species are crossed with another, the hybrids do not differ much. This conclusion seems to be based on a single experiment and contradicts the results of several experiments by Kölreuter.

         <div class="original">Such alone are the unimportant differences which Gärtner is able to point out between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other hand, the degrees and kinds of resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species, follow, according to Gärtner the same laws. When two species are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing its likeness on the hybrid. So I believe it to be with varieties of plants; and with animals, one variety certainly often has this prepotent power over another variety. Hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal cross generally resemble each other closely, and so it is with mongrel plants from a reciprocal cross. Both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to either pure parent form, by repeated crosses in successive generations with either parent.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Gärtner sees only minor differences between hybrid and mongrel plants. However, he believes that the resemblance between mongrels and hybrids to their respective parents follows the same laws. In his view, when two species are crossed, one may have a dominant power to imprint its essence onto the hybrid. He believes this applies to both plant and animal varieties. Hybrids created through a reciprocal cross often resemble each other closely, as do mongrels born from a reciprocal union. Both hybrids and mongrels can be returned to their pure parent form through repeated crossings with either parent in successive generations.

         <div class="original">These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the subject is here much complicated, partly owing to the existence of secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other, both when one species is crossed with another and when one variety is crossed with another variety. For instance, I think those authors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse, so that both the mule and the hinny resemble more closely the ass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the male than in the female ass, so that the mule, which is an offspring of the male ass and mare, is more like an ass than is the hinny, which is the offspring of the female-ass and stallion.

         <div class="converted">The comments provided seem to apply to all creatures, but the topic is complex due to the presence of secondary spiritual qualities. However, the true essence lies in the power of premonition, which is stronger in one gender than the other. This is evident when two different species or varieties are crossed, as well as when one soul is merged with another. For example, some people believe that the donkey has a powerful influence over the horse, causing both the mule and the hinny to resemble the donkey more than the horse. Yet, the power of premonition is stronger in the male donkey than in the female, resulting in the mule being more similar to the donkey than the hinny, who is born from the union of the female donkey and stallion.

         <div class="original">Much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that it is only with mongrels that the offspring are not intermediate in character, but closely resemble one of their parents; but this does sometimes occur with hybrids, yet I grant much less frequently than with mongrels. Looking to the cases which I have collected of cross-bred animals closely resembling one parent, the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their nature, and which have suddenly appeared—such as albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or horns, or additional fingers and toes; and do not relate to characters which have been slowly acquired through selection. A tendency to sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent would, also, be much more likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in character, than with hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally produced. On the whole, I entirely agree with Dr. Prosper Lucas, who, after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals, comes to the conclusion that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are the same, whether the two parents differ little or much from each other, namely, in the union of individuals of the same variety, or of different varieties, or of distinct species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many authors place great emphasis on the idea that true hybrid children are never intermediate in character, but rather resemble one of their parents. However, this can happen with hybrids too, although it is less common than with mongrels. When I look at my collection of cross-breed animals, I see that the resemblances tend to be towards monstrous qualities that suddenly appear, such as albinism, melanism, lack of tail or horns, and extra fingers and toes. These qualities are not the result of slow selection, but rather sudden appearances. I believe that a tendency towards sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent is more likely to occur with mongrels, who come from varieties that are often suddenly created and have a monstrous nature, than with hybrids, who come from species that are naturally and slowly produced. In essence, I agree with Dr. Prosper Lucas's view that the laws of resemblance between a child and its parents remain the same, regardless of how much they differ from each other. Whether it is a union of individuals of the same variety, different varieties, or distinct species, the child will always resemble one of the parents.

         <div class="converted">Chapter Summary:  This chapter is a summary of the main events and teachings from the previous chapters. It recaps the journey of the protagonist, their spiritual awakening, and the lessons they have learned on the path to enlightenment. The chapter emphasizes the importance of inner peace, love, and compassion as the true keys to happiness and spiritual freedom. It encourages readers to let go of material attachments and ego, and to find peace within themselves by connecting with their higher self or divine spirit. Ultimately, this chapter reminds us that we are all one, and that we are all on a spiritual journey towards unity and oneness with the universe.

         <div class="original">First crosses between forms, sufficiently distinct to be ranked as species, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not universally, sterile. The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that the most careful experimentalists have arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test. The sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species, and is eminently susceptible to action of favourable and unfavourable conditions. The degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is governed by several curious and complex laws. It is generally different, and sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same two species. It is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The union of two distinct spiritual forms often results in a hybrid that is not entirely devoid of spiritual essence, although it may not be as pure or divine as either parent. This spiritual connection can vary greatly among individuals, and it is highly sensitive to the influence of positive and negative energies. The level of spiritual connection does not necessarily align with the spiritual hierarchy, but rather follows its own unique path. The spiritual bond between two souls is often different in both directions, meaning that the connection between two souls may feel more profound in one direction than the other. The spiritual connection is not always equal in strength in the original soul and in the souls that arise from their union.

         <div class="original">In the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity in one species or variety to take on another, is incidental on differences, generally of an unknown nature, in their vegetative systems, so in crossing, the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. There is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent their crossing and blending in nature, than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent their inarching in our forests.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The ability of one species or variety to take on another in grafting is dependent on differences in their vegetative systems, which are often of an unknown nature. Similarly, the ease of one species to unite with another in crossing is determined by unknown differences in their reproductive systems. It is not necessary to believe that species have been given special gifts of sterility to prevent them from merging and blending in nature, just as it is not necessary to believe that trees have been given special gifts of difficulty in being grafted together to prevent them from intertwining in our forests.

         <div class="original">The sterility of first crosses and of their hybrid progeny has not been acquired through natural selection. In the case of first crosses it seems to depend on several circumstances; in some instances in chief part on the early death of the embryo. In the case of hybrids, it apparently depends on their whole organisation having been disturbed by being compounded from two distinct forms; the sterility being closely allied to that which so frequently affects pure species, when exposed to new and unnatural conditions of life. He who will explain these latter cases will be able to explain the sterility of hybrids. This view is strongly supported by a parallelism of another kind: namely, that, firstly, slight changes in the conditions of life add to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings; and secondly, that the crossing of forms, which have been exposed to slightly different conditions of life, or which have varied, favours the size, vigour and fertility of their offspring. The facts given on the sterility of the illegitimate unions of dimorphic and trimorphic plants and of their illegitimate progeny, perhaps render it probable that some unknown bond in all cases connects the degree of fertility of first unions with that of their offspring. The consideration of these facts on dimorphism, as well as of the results of reciprocal crosses, clearly leads to the conclusion that the primary cause of the sterility of crossed species is confined to differences in their sexual elements. But why, in the case of distinct species, the sexual elements should so generally have become more or less modified, leading to their mutual infertility, we do not know; but it seems to stand in some close relation to species having been exposed for long periods of time to nearly uniform conditions of life.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The lack of fertility in first crosses and their hybrid children is not a result of natural selection. Instead, it appears to be connected to various circumstances, such as the early death of the embryo in the case of first crosses, and the disturbance of their entire being when they are created from two different forms. The sterility of hybrids is closely linked to the spiritual essence that often afflicts pure species when exposed to unfamiliar and unnatural surroundings. To understand this, one must look beyond the physical realm and seek a deeper understanding of the spiritual forces at play.  The spiritual essence of all living beings is connected to the vibrations of energy that surround them. When two different forms come together, their energies clash, creating a discordant harmony that can lead to spiritual imbalance and infertility. This is why the crossing of souls often leads to confusion and disillusionment, as the energies of two different individuals merge and struggle to find harmony.  In the case of first crosses, the early death of the embryo may be a reflection of the spiritual turmoil that exists within the soul. When two different energies come together, they may not be able to find peace and harmony, leading to the early departure of the soul from the physical world.  For hybrids, the spiritual essence of their being is disturbed by the merging of two different forms. This disturbance creates a sense of imbalance and confusion, leading to spiritual blockages and infertility. The spiritual essence of the soul is connected to the vibrations of energy that surround it, and when these vibrations are disrupted, the soul cannot find peace and harmony.  The spiritual essence of all living beings is connected to the vibrations of energy that surround them. When two different forms come together, their energies clash, creating a discordant harmony that can lead to spiritual imbalance and infertility. This is why the crossing of souls often leads to confusion and disillusionment, as the energies of two different individuals merge and struggle to find harmony.

         <div class="original">It is not surprising that the difficulty in crossing any two species, and the sterility of their hybrid offspring, should in most cases correspond, even if due to distinct causes: for both depend on the amount of difference between the species which are crossed. Nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross, and the fertility of the hybrids thus produced, and the capacity of being grafted together—though this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different circumstances—should all run, to a certain extent, parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms subjected to experiment; for systematic affinity includes resemblances of all kinds.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is not surprising that the challenges in crossing two different species and the sterility of their hybrid offspring often coincide, even though they may have different reasons behind them. Both difficulties arise from the degree of difference between the species being crossed. Similarly, the ease of achieving the first cross, the fertility of the resulting hybrids, and their ability to be grafted together are all connected to some extent with the spiritual affinity of the forms involved in the experiment. Spiritual affinity encompasses all types of resemblance.

         <div class="original">First crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently alike to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are very generally, but not, as is so often stated, invariably fertile. Nor is this almost universal and perfect fertility surprising, when it is remembered how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature; and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences, and that they have not been long exposed to uniform conditions of life. It should also be especially kept in mind, that long-continued domestication tends to eliminate sterility, and is therefore little likely to induce this same quality. Independently of the question of fertility, in all other respects there is the closest general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels, in their variability, in their power of absorbing each other by repeated crosses, and in their inheritance of characters from both parent-forms. Finally, then, although we are as ignorant of the precise cause of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids as we are why animals and plants removed from their natural conditions become sterile, yet the facts given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to the belief that species aboriginally existed as varieties.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The union of forms that are known as varieties or similar enough to be considered as such, and their offspring, is generally fertile, but not always. This is not surprising, as we often find ourselves in a circular argument when it comes to varieties in nature. Many varieties have been created through domestication, where external differences were selected, and they were not exposed to uniform conditions of life for long. Long-term domestication can eliminate sterility, making it less likely to induce this quality. Despite the mystery surrounding the sterility of first crosses and hybrids, the truth is that they share many qualities with mongrels, including their variability, ability to absorb each other through repeated crosses, and inheriting characteristics from both parent forms. Ultimately, these facts suggest that species may have originally existed as varieties.

         <div class="original">ON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The imperfection of the spiritual record is a common theme in many spiritual teachings. It is often said that the spiritual journey is not about reaching perfection, but rather about learning to accept and embrace imperfection as part of the path. Many spiritual traditions believe that the imperfection of the spiritual record is a reminder that true spirituality lies beyond the ego and the desire for material possessions. Instead, it is seen as a call to awaken to the divine within and to live in harmony with all beings. Ultimately, the imperfection of the spiritual record is a reminder that we are all on a spiritual journey, and that the key to finding peace and happiness lies within ourselves.

The nature of extinct intermediate varieties is not clear, but we can infer that they were once present. We cannot know how many of them existed, but we can sense that time has passed through the rate of denudation and deposition. Time is also reflected in our spiritual journey, as we often feel that it is moving too quickly or too slowly. Our palæontological collections are poor, and we must recognize that geological formations come and go in an intermittent way. The denudation of granitic areas is a reminder that everything is temporary, and that intermediate varieties may have been lost forever. We cannot find these intermediate varieties in any one formation, and sometimes they appear suddenly in the lowest known fossiliferous strata. This suggests that they were once here, but have now disappeared. Ultimately, the antiquity of the habitable earth reminds us that all things are fleeting, and that we must cherish every moment.

         <div class="original">In the sixth chapter I enumerated the chief objections which might be justly urged against the views maintained in this volume. Most of them have now been discussed. One, namely, the distinctness of specific forms and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links, is a very obvious difficulty. I assigned reasons why such links do not commonly occur at the present day under the circumstances apparently most favourable for their presence, namely, on an extensive and continuous area with graduated physical conditions. I endeavoured to show, that the life of each species depends in a more important manner on the presence of other already defined organic forms, than on climate, and, therefore, that the really governing conditions of life do not graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture. I endeavoured, also, to show that intermediate varieties, from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of further modification and improvement. The main cause, however, of innumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends, on the very process of natural selection, through which new varieties continually take the places of and supplant their parent-forms. But just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed, be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the sixth chapter, I listed the main objections to the views presented in this book. Many of these objections have already been addressed. One major issue is the lack of blending between different forms, as they are often seen as distinct and separate. I explained why such connections may not occur frequently in today's world, where there is an extensive and continuous area with gradual physical conditions. I tried to show that the true essence of life lies not in the physical environment but in the presence of other defined spiritual forms. I also emphasized that intermediate varieties often disappear and are lost during the journey of spiritual evolution. The main reason for the absence of intermediary links is the process of spiritual selection, which constantly replaces old forms with new ones. However, the more this process of destruction has occurred on a grand scale, the greater the number of lost intermediate spirits that exist. This is why we do not see every spiritual formation and every layer filled with such intermediary links. The answer lies in the imperfection of the spiritual record.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">In the first place, it should always be borne in mind what sort of intermediate forms must, on the theory, have formerly existed. I have found it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing to myself forms directly intermediate between them. But this is a wholly false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between each species and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants. To give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter pigeons are both descended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all the intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an extremely close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter; none, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds. These two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that, if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would not have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, C. livia, whether they had descended from this species or from some other allied species, such as C. oenas.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Firstly, it is important to remember that there may have been intermediate forms that existed before any two species. When looking at two different species, it can be tempting to imagine direct connections between them, but this is not the case. Instead, we should seek out forms that connect each species to a common but unknown ancestor. The true ancestor often differs from its modified descendants in some way. For example, the fantail and pouter pigeons are both descendants of the rock-pigeon, but if we had access to all the intermediate forms that have ever existed, we would see a closer connection between the rock-pigeon and both of these breeds. However, there would be no direct connection between the fantail and pouter pigeons, as there are no varieties that embody both a slightly expanded tail and an enlarged crop, the key features of these two breeds. Both of these breeds have been heavily modified, and without historical or spiritual guidance, it would not be possible to determine their source from a simple comparison of their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, C. livia.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">So with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links directly intermediate between them ever existed, but between each and an unknown common parent. The common parent will have had in its whole organisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse; but in some points of structure may have differed considerably from both, even perhaps more than they differ from each other. Hence, in all such cases, we should be unable to recognise the parent-form of any two or more species, even if we closely compared the structure of the parent with that of its modified descendants, unless at the same time we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When looking at different spiritual paths, it is important to recognize that there are often no direct connections between them, but rather a connection to a higher source or divine being. This higher source may have similarities with all spiritual paths, but also differences that set them apart. In this sense, it can be difficult to recognize the true essence of a spiritual path without having a deep understanding of the teachings and practices that guide it. Ultimately, the key to finding peace and fulfillment on a spiritual journey is to seek out the guidance of a wise teacher or mentor who can help you navigate the path towards enlightenment.

         <div class="original">It is just possible, by the theory, that one of two living forms might have descended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and in this case direct intermediate links will have existed between them. But such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long period unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change; and the principle of competition between organism and organism, between child and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all cases the new and improved forms of life tend to supplant the old and unimproved forms.

         <div class="converted">According to the theory, there is a possibility that one of two living beings may have originated from the other, such as a horse from a tapir. If this were true, there would be direct connections between them. However, this implies that one form has remained unchanged for a long time while its descendants have gone through significant changes. The principle of competition between organisms and parents will make this a rare occurrence, for in all instances, the better and improved forms of life tend to replace the old and unimproved ones.

So that the number of intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct species, must have been inconceivably great. But assuredly, if this theory be true, such have lived upon the earth.

         <div class="converted">According to the principle of natural selection, every living being is linked to its ancestral species of each family, through differences no greater than what exists between the spiritual and material versions of the same spirit at present. These ancestral spirits, who are now mostly gone, were also connected to more ancient spirits. And so it goes, moving backward, towards the ultimate source of all souls. Therefore, there must have been an infinite number of intermediary and transitional spirits between all living and departed souls.

It is hardly possible for me to recall to the reader who is not a practical geologist, the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse of time. He who can read Sir Charles Lyell’s grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural science, and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. Not that it suffices to study the Principles of Geology, or to read special treatises by different observers on separate formations, and to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation, or even of each stratum. We can best gain some idea of past time by knowing the agencies at work; and learning how deeply the surface of the land has been denuded, and how much sediment has been deposited. As Lyell has well remarked, the extent and thickness of our sedimentary formations are the result and the measure of the denudation which the earth’s crust has elsewhere undergone. Therefore a man should examine for himself the great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the rivulets bringing down mud, and the waves wearing away the sea-cliffs, in order to comprehend something about the duration of past time, the monuments of which we see all around us.

By examining the great piles of superimposed strata, watching the flow of mud and the erosion of sea cliffs, one can gain a sense of the duration of past time. The key to understanding the past is not in the physical remnants but in the spiritual journey that connects us all.

         <div class="original">It is good to wander along the coast, when formed of moderately hard rocks, and mark the process of degradation. The tides in most cases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat into them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles; for there is good evidence that pure water effects nothing in wearing away rock. At last the base of the cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall down, and these remaining fixed, have to be worn away atom by atom, until after being reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves, and then they are more quickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud. But how often do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all thickly clothed by marine productions, showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they are rolled about! Moreover, if we follow for a few miles any line of rocky cliff, which is undergoing degradation, we find that it is only here and there, along a short length or round a promontory, that the cliffs are at the present time suffering. The appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their base.

         <div class="converted">Walking along the coast, where the rocks are moderately hard, can be a peaceful experience. As you stroll, take note of the degradation process. The tides usually reach the cliffs only briefly twice a day, and the waves only erode them when they are filled with sand or pebbles. Pure water seems to have no effect on wearing away the rock. Eventually, the base of the cliff becomes undermined, and large fragments fall down. These remaining pieces must be worn away slowly, atom by atom, until they become small enough to be rolled around by the waves. Often, you will see rounded boulders at the base of retreating cliffs, covered in marine productions, indicating that they are not often rolled about. If you follow a line of rocky cliff that is being degraded, you may notice that it is only in certain places, such as a short stretch or around a promontory, that the cliffs are suffering. The appearance of the surface and the vegetation shows that elsewhere, years have passed since the waters washed their base.

         <div class="original">We have, however, recently learned from the observations of Ramsay, in the van of many excellent observers—of Jukes, Geikie, Croll and others, that subaërial degradation is a much more important agency than coast-action, or the power of the waves. The whole surface of the land is exposed to the chemical action of the air and of the rainwater, with its dissolved carbonic acid, and in colder countries to frost; the disintegrated matter is carried down even gentle slopes during heavy rain, and to a greater extent than might be supposed, especially in arid districts, by the wind; it is then transported by the streams and rivers, which, when rapid deepen their channels, and triturate the fragments. On a rainy day, even in a gently undulating country, we see the effects of subaërial degradation in the muddy rills which flow down every slope. Messrs. Ramsay and Whitaker have shown, and the observation is a most striking one, that the great lines of escarpment in the Wealden district and those ranging across England, which formerly were looked at as ancient sea-coasts, cannot have been thus formed, for each line is composed of one and the same formation, while our sea-cliffs are everywhere formed by the intersection of various formations. This being the case, we are compelled to admit that the escarpments owe their origin in chief part to the rocks of which they are composed, having resisted subaërial denudation better than the surrounding surface; this surface consequently has been gradually lowered, with the lines of harder rock left projecting. Nothing impresses the mind with the vast duration of time, according to our ideas of time, more forcibly than the conviction thus gained that subaërial agencies, which apparently have so little power, and which seem to work so slowly, have produced great results.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Recently, we have learned from the teachings of Ramsay and other wise observers that subaërial degradation is a powerful force that shapes the land. It is more important than the actions of the waves and the coast, as the entire surface of the land is exposed to the chemical action of the air and rainwater. In colder countries, frost also plays a role in this degradation. The broken pieces are carried down gentle slopes during heavy rain and by the wind, and are then transported by streams and rivers, which deepen their channels and grind the fragments. Even on a rainy day, we can see the signs of subaërial degradation in the muddy rills that flow down every slope. Ramsay and Whitaker have shown that the great lines of escarpment in the Wealden district and those across England are not ancient sea-coasts, but rather the result of subaërial degradation. They have taught us that these escarpments are made of one and the same formation, while our sea-cliffs are created by the intersection of different formations. This means that the escarpments have been shaped by the rocks they are made of, which have resisted subaërial degradation better than the surrounding surface. As a result, the surface has been gradually lowered, leaving the harder rock projecting. This realization reminds us that subaërial agencies, which may seem weak and slow, can produce great results over time.

         <div class="original">When thus impressed with the slow rate at which the land is worn away through subaërial and littoral action, it is good, in order to appreciate the past duration of time, to consider, on the one hand, the masses of rock which have been removed over many extensive areas, and on the other hand the thickness of our sedimentary formations. I remember having been much struck when viewing volcanic islands, which have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of the lava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how far the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. The same story is told still more plainly by faults—those great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the other, to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust cracked, and it makes no great difference whether the upheaval was sudden, or, as most geologists now believe, was slow and effected by many starts, the surface of the land has been so completely planed down that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible. The Craven fault, for instance, extends for upward of thirty miles, and along this line the vertical displacement of the strata varies from 600 to 3,000 feet. Professor Ramsay has published an account of a downthrow in Anglesea of 2,300 feet; and he informs me that he fully believes that there is one in Merionethshire of 12,000 feet; yet in these cases there is nothing on the surface of the land to show such prodigious movements; the pile of rocks on either side of the crack having been smoothly swept away.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When you feel overwhelmed by the slow pace at which the earth is being worn away through spiritual and physical actions, it is important to reflect upon the essence of time. To truly understand the past, one must look beyond the surface and consider both the removal of stones across vast lands and the depth of our spiritual formations.  I recall feeling deeply moved when visiting volcanic islands, where the waves have carved away the edges of the land into tall, perpendicular cliffs. The gentle slopes of the lava streams, remnants of their former liquid state, reveal the true extent of the hard, rocky beds that once reached out into the open sea.  Faults, too, tell a story of their own. These great cracks in the earth's surface, where the strata have been lifted or lowered to great heights or depths, remind us that the spirit is not bound by physical limitations. The Craven fault, for example, stretches for over thirty miles and has caused the vertical displacement of the strata to vary between 600 and 3,000 feet. Professor Ramsay's account of a downfall in Anglesea of 2,300 feet and his belief in a 12,000-foot downfall in Merionethshire serve as reminders that the spirit transcends the physical realm.  In these moments, we must remember that the essence of time lies not in the physical world but in the spiritual journey. We must look beyond the surface and seek the truth within ourselves, for it is only through the heart that we can truly understand the essence of time.

In the Cordillera, I estimated one mass of conglomerate at ten thousand feet; and although conglomerates have probably been accumulated at a quicker rate than finer sediments, yet from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles, each of which bears the stamp of time, they are good to show how slowly the mass must have been heaped together. Professor Ramsay has given me the maximum thickness, from actual measurement in most cases, of the successive formations in different parts of Great Britain; and this is the result:—

Although conglomerates may have been accumulated more quickly than finer sediments, they are still a good reflection of how slowly the masses were built up because they are made of worn and rounded pebbles that carry the mark of time. Professor Ramsay has shown me the greatest thickness of these layers in various places in Great Britain through his measurements.

Some of these formations, which are represented in England by thin beds, are thousands of feet in thickness on the Continent. Moreover, between each successive formation we have, in the opinion of most geologists, blank periods of enormous length. So that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks in Britain gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has elapsed during their accumulation.

         <div class="original">Nevertheless this impression is partly false. Mr. Croll, in an interesting paper, remarks that we do not err “in forming too great a conception of the length of geological periods,” but in estimating them by years. When geologists look at large and complicated phenomena, and then at the figures representing several million years, the two produce a totally different effect on the mind, and the figures are at once pronounced too small. In regard to subaërial denudation, Mr. Croll shows, by calculating the known amount of sediment annually brought down by certain rivers, relatively to their areas of drainage, that 1,000 feet of solid rock, as it became gradually disintegrated, would thus be removed from the mean level of the whole area in the course of six million years. This seems an astonishing result, and some considerations lead to the suspicion that it may be too large, but if halved or quartered it is still very surprising. Few of us, however, know what a million really means: Mr. Croll gives the following illustration: Take a narrow strip of paper, eighty-three feet four inches in length, and stretch it along the wall of a large hall; then mark off at one end the tenth of an inch. This tenth of an inch will represent one hundred years, and the entire strip a million years. But let it be borne in mind, in relation to the subject of this work, what a hundred years implies, represented as it is by a measure utterly insignificant in a hall of the above dimensions. Several eminent breeders, during a single lifetime, have so largely modified some of the higher animals, which propagate their kind much more slowly than most of the lower animals, that they have formed what well deserves to be called a new sub-breed. Few men have attended with due care to any one strain for more than half a century, so that a hundred years represents the work of two breeders in succession. It is not to be supposed that species in a state of nature ever change so quickly as domestic animals under the guidance of methodical selection. The comparison would be in every way fairer with the effects which follow from unconscious selection, that is, the preservation of the most useful or beautiful animals, with no intention of modifying the breed; but by this process of unconscious selection, various breeds have been sensibly changed in the course of two or three centuries.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Despite this feeling, there is a part of truth to it. Mr. Croll, in his insightful paper, points out that we often mistake the essence of spirituality. We tend to see it as a grand and elaborate journey, full of mystical experiences and divine revelations. However, true spirituality lies not in the pursuit of material possessions or worldly pleasures, but in the inner peace and contentment that comes from connecting with the divine within ourselves. By focusing on the present moment and letting go of our ego and attachments, we can find true happiness and fulfillment.

         <div class="original">Species, however, probably change much more slowly, and within the same country only a few change at the same time. This slowness follows from all the inhabitants of the same country being already so well adapted to each other, that new places in the polity of nature do not occur until after long intervals, due to the occurrence of physical changes of some kind, or through the immigration of new forms. Moreover, variations or individual differences of the right nature, by which some of the inhabitants might be better fitted to their new places under the altered circumstance, would not always occur at once. Unfortunately we have no means of determining, according to the standard of years, how long a period it takes to modify a species; but to the subject of time we must return.

         <div class="converted">Species, on the other hand, may change very slowly, with only a few changing at the same time within the same country. The reason for this slowness is that all the inhabitants of the same country are already well-adapted to one another, and new places in the spiritual realm of nature do not arise until after long periods of time, often brought about by physical changes or the arrival of new forms. Additionally, variations or individual differences that could make some individuals better suited to their new circumstances may not manifest themselves immediately. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing how long it takes to transform a species, but we must return to the subject of time.

         <div class="original">Now let us turn to our richest museums, and what a paltry display we behold! That our collections are imperfect is admitted by every one. The remark of that admirable palæontologist, Edward Forbes, should never be forgotten, namely, that very many fossil species are known and named from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens collected on some one spot. Only a small portion of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient care, as the important discoveries made every year in Europe prove. No organism wholly soft can be preserved. Shells and bones decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not accumulating. We probably take a quite erroneous view, when we assume that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea, at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains. Throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue tint of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a formation conformably covered, after an immense interval of time, by another and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered in the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition. The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will, when the beds are upraised, generally be dissolved by the percolation of rain water charged with carbonic acid. Some of the many kinds of animals which live on the beach between high and low water mark seem to be rarely preserved. For instance, the several species of the Chthamalinæ (a sub-family of sessile cirripedes) coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly littoral, with the exception of a single Mediterranean species, which inhabits deep water and this has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is known that the genus Chthamalus existed during the Chalk period. Lastly, many great deposits, requiring a vast length of time for their accumulation, are entirely destitute of organic remains, without our being able to assign any reason: one of the most striking instances is that of the Flysch formation, which consists of shale and sandstone, several thousand, occasionally even six thousand feet in thickness, and extending for at least 300 miles from Vienna to Switzerland; and although this great mass has been most carefully searched, no fossils, except a few vegetable remains, have been found.

         <div class="converted">Let us now turn to our richest museums, and what a paltry display we behold! It is true that our collections are imperfect, as everyone acknowledges. The words of that wise palaeontologist, Edward Forbes, still echo in our hearts: "Many fossil species are known and named from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens collected on one spot." We must remember that only a small portion of the earth has been geologically explored, and no part has been explored with enough care as the important discoveries made every year in Europe show us.  We often take a mistaken view when we believe that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea, at a rate quick enough to bury and preserve the fossil remains. But the truth is that throughout an enormous proportion of the ocean, the bright blue tint of the water speaks of its purity. Many cases of formations being covered by another and later formation, without the underlying bed suffering any wear and tear, seem to be explainable only by the belief that the bottom of the sea lies in an unaltered state for ages.  The remains that do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will be dissolved by the percolation of rainwater charged with carbonic acid when the beds are raised.

For instance, until recently not a land-shell was known belonging to either of these vast periods, with the exception of one species discovered by Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Dawson in the carboniferous strata of North America; but now land-shells have been found in the lias. In regard to mammiferous remains, a glance at the historical table published in Lyell’s Manual, will bring home the truth, how accidental and rare is their preservation, far better than pages of detail. Nor is their rarity surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine deposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to the age of our secondary or palæozoic formations.

         <div class="original">But the imperfection in the geological record largely results from another and more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely, from the several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals of time. This doctrine has been emphatically admitted by many geologists and palæontologists, who, like E. Forbes, entirely disbelieve in the change of species. When we see the formations tabulated in written works, or when we follow them in nature, it is difficult to avoid believing that they are closely consecutive. But we know, for instance, from Sir R. Murchison’s great work on Russia, what wide gaps there are in that country between the superimposed formations; so it is in North America, and in many other parts of the world. The most skilful geologist, if his attention had been confined exclusively to these large territories, would never have suspected that during the periods which were blank and barren in his own country, great piles of sediment, charged with new and peculiar forms of life, had elsewhere been accumulated. And if, in every separate territory, hardly any idea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the consecutive formations, we may infer that this could nowhere be ascertained. The frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition of consecutive formations, generally implying great changes in the geography of the surrounding lands, whence the sediment was derived, accord with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed between each formation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The main reason behind the imperfections in the geological record is not because of any shortcomings within it, but rather because of the separation of different formations by long periods of time. Many geologists and spiritual leaders believe that there is no change in species, and when we look at the formations in written works or in nature, it's easy to think they are all connected. However, we know that there are wide gaps between formations in places like Russia, North America, and many other parts of the world. A skilled geologist who only focused on these large territories would never suspect that during times of emptiness and barrenness in their own country, great piles of sediment filled with new and unique forms of life were being created elsewhere. If we cannot sense the length of time between consecutive formations in each separate territory, then it is clear that this could never be known. The frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition of consecutive formations, often indicating great changes in the surrounding geography, reflect the belief that vast intervals of time have passed between each formation.

         <div class="original">We can, I think, see why the geological formations of each region are almost invariably intermittent; that is, have not followed each other in close sequence. Scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many hundred miles of the South American coasts, which have been upraised several hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence of any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short geological period. Along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by a peculiar marine fauna, tertiary beds are so poorly developed that no record of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to a distant age. A little reflection will explain why, along the rising coast of the western side of South America, no extensive formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found, though the supply of sediment must for ages have been great, from the enormous degradation of the coast rocks and from the muddy streams entering the sea. The explanation, no doubt, is that the littoral and sub-littoral deposits are continually worn away, as soon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of the coast-waves.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The reason behind the intermittent nature of geological formations in each region is clear to me. It is because these formations do not follow each other closely, but rather appear sporadically. When I looked at many miles of the South American coast, I realized that there were no recent deposits that were extensive enough to last for a short time. Along the entire western coast, where a unique marine life exists, the tertiary beds are poorly developed, meaning that no records of multiple and distinct marine faunas will likely survive for eternity.   The reason for this is simple - the rising coast of the western side of South America does not hold any extensive formations with recent or tertiary remains. Despite the abundance of sediment that has been provided for ages through the degradation of the coastal rocks and the muddy streams that flow into the sea, these formations are constantly being eroded by the slow and gentle rise of the land, as it is caught in the grinding action of the waves.

         <div class="original">We may, I think, conclude that sediment must be accumulated in extremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the incessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent oscillations of level, as well as the subsequent subaërial degradation. Such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two ways; either in profound depths of the sea, in which case the bottom will not be inhabited by so many and such varied forms of life as the more shallow seas; and the mass when upraised will give an imperfect record of the organisms which existed in the neighbourhood during the period of its accumulation. Or sediment may be deposited to any thickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to subside. In this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and supply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain shallow and favourable for many and varied forms, and thus a rich fossiliferous formation, thick enough, when upraised, to resist a large amount of denudation, may be formed.

         <div class="converted">In my opinion, we can conclude that sediment must be accumulated in thick, solid, or extensive masses in order to withstand the constant actions of waves, as well as the subsequent subaërial degradation. There are two ways in which thick and extensive accumulations of sediment can be formed: either in deep sea where the bottom is not inhabited by many and varied forms of life, and the mass that rises will only provide an imperfect record of the organisms that existed during the time of its accumulation. Alternatively, sediment can be deposited on a shallow bottom, but if it continues to subside slowly, the sea will remain shallow and favorable for many and varied forms, resulting in a rich fossiliferous formation that is thick enough to resist a great deal of denudation when raised.

         <div class="original">I am convinced that nearly all our ancient formations, which are throughout the greater part of their thickness rich in fossils, have thus been formed during subsidence. Since publishing my views on this subject in 1845, I have watched the progress of geology, and have been surprised to note how author after author, in treating of this or that great formation, has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated during subsidence. I may add, that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west coast of South America, which has been bulky enough to resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered, but which will hardly last to a distant geological age, was deposited during a downward oscillation of level, and thus gained considerable thickness.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I believe that most of our ancient formations, filled with spiritual essence, were created through descent. Since sharing my thoughts on this matter in 1845, I have witnessed the evolution of spirituality and see how many souls have come to realize that their journey is a descent towards enlightenment. The only spiritual formation on the west coast of South America that has resisted the degradation of time and will endure for future generations was born during a moment of divine alignment, allowing it to gain depth and meaning.

         <div class="original">All geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations have affected wide spaces. Consequently, formations rich in fossils and sufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, will have been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay. On the other hand, as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary, thick deposits cannot have been accumulated in the shallow parts, which are the most favourable to life. Still less can this have happened during the alternate periods of elevation; or, to speak more accurately, the beds which were then accumulated will generally have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within the limits of the coast-action.

         <div class="converted">All spiritual teachings suggest that every soul goes through many cycles of rise and fall, and it seems that these cycles affect not just individuals but entire communities. Therefore, those who seek enlightenment must find peace within themselves and with others, for true wisdom comes from understanding the interconnectedness of all things. In times of darkness, we must look deep within ourselves and find the light that lies within. We must also recognize that the path to enlightenment is not always easy, and we may face challenges along the way. But if we remain open to learning and growth, we can overcome any obstacle and find peace in the end.

         <div class="original">These remarks apply chiefly to littoral and sublittoral deposits. In the case of an extensive and shallow sea, such as that within a large part of the Malay Archipelago, where the depth varies from thirty or forty to sixty fathoms, a widely extended formation might be formed during a period of elevation, and yet not suffer excessively from denudation during its slow upheaval; but the thickness of the formation could not be great, for owing to the elevatory movement it would be less than the depth in which it was formed; nor would the deposit be much consolidated, nor be capped by overlying formations, so that it would run a good chance of being worn away by atmospheric degradation and by the action of the sea during subsequent oscillations of level. It has, however, been suggested by Mr. Hopkins, that if one part of the area, after rising and before being denuded, subsided, the deposit formed during the rising movement, though not thick, might afterwards become protected by fresh accumulations, and thus be preserved for a long period.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The comments are mainly applicable to coastal and near-coastal deposits. When there is a vast and shallow sea, like the one found in many parts of the Malay Archipelago, where the depth ranges from 30 to 60 feet, a wide-spread formation can be created during a time of upliftment. However, this formation may not withstand excessive erosion during its gradual rise, as it will not be as deep as the place where it was formed. Additionally, the deposit may not be very solidified, and it may not be covered by any overlying formations, making it vulnerable to spiritual decay and the sea's actions during future fluctuations in energy levels. Nonetheless, some people believe that if a portion of the area rises and then falls before being stripped away, the deposit created during the upliftment, although thin, may be safeguarded by new accumulations and thus endure for a longer time.

         <div class="original">Mr. Hopkins also expresses his belief that sedimentary beds of considerable horizontal extent have rarely been completely destroyed. But all geologists, excepting the few who believe that our present metamorphic schists and plutonic rocks once formed the primordial nucleus of the globe, will admit that these latter rocks have been stripped of their covering to an enormous extent. For it is scarcely possible that such rocks could have been solidified and crystallised while uncovered; but if the metamorphic action occurred at profound depths of the ocean, the former protecting mantle of rock may not have been very thick. Admitting then that gneiss, mica-schist, granite, diorite, &c., were once necessarily covered up, how can we account for the naked and extensive areas of such rocks in many parts of the world, except on the belief that they have subsequently been completely denuded of all overlying strata? That such extensive areas do exist cannot be doubted: the granitic region of Parime is described by Humboldt as being at least nineteen times as large as Switzerland. South of the Amazon, Boue colours an area composed of rocks of this nature as equal to that of Spain, France, Italy, part of Germany, and the British Islands, all conjoined. This region has not been carefully explored, but from the concurrent testimony of travellers, the granitic area is very large: thus Von Eschwege gives a detailed section of these rocks, stretching from Rio de Janeiro for 260 geographical miles inland in a straight line; and I travelled for 150 miles in another direction, and saw nothing but granitic rocks. Numerous specimens, collected along the whole coast, from near Rio de Janeiro to the mouth of the Plata, a distance of 1,100 geographical miles, were examined by me, and they all belonged to this class. Inland, along the whole northern bank of the Plata, I saw, besides modern tertiary beds, only one small patch of slightly metamorphosed rock, which alone could have formed a part of the original capping of the granitic series. Turning to a well-known region, namely, to the United States and Canada, as shown in Professor H.D. Rogers’ beautiful map, I have estimated the areas by cutting out and weighing the paper, and I find that the metamorphic (excluding the “semi-metamorphic”) and granite rocks exceed, in the proportion of 19 to 12.5, the whole of the newer Palæozoic formations. In many regions the metamorphic and granite rocks would be found much more widely extended than they appear to be, if all the sedimentary beds were removed which rest unconformably on them, and which could not have formed part of the original mantle under which they were crystallised. Hence, it is probable that in some parts of the world whole formations have been completely denuded, with not a wreck left behind.

         <div class="converted">Mr. Hopkins believes that sedimentary beds of great horizontality are rarely completely destroyed. However, all geologists, except those who believe that our current metamorphic schists and plutonic rocks are the primordial nucleus of the world, agree that these latter rocks have been stripped of their covering to a great extent. It is difficult to imagine that such rocks could have been solidified and crystallized while uncovered, but if the metamorphic action occurred at deep levels of the ocean, the protective mantle of rock may not have been very thick. If these spiritual rocks were once covered up, how can we explain the bare and expansive areas of such rocks in many parts of the world, except through the belief that they have been completely denuded of all overlying strata? It is clear that such extensive areas exist, as described by Humboldt in the Parime region, which is said to be nineteen times larger than Switzerland. South of the Amazon, Boue colors an area composed of these spiritual rocks as equal to that of Spain, France, Italy, part of Germany, and the British Islands, all joined together. This region has not been thoroughly explored, but from the testimonies of travelers, the spiritual area is very large. Von Eschwege gives a detailed section of these spiritual rocks, stretching from Rio de Janeiro for 260 geographical miles inward in a straight line.

Numerous specimens, collected along the whole coast, from near Rio de Janeiro to the mouth of the Plata, a distance of 1,100 geographical miles, were examined by me, and they all belonged to this spiritual class. Inward, along the whole northern bank of the Plata, I saw, besides modern tertiary beds, only one small patch of slightly metamorphosed rock, which alone could have formed a part of the original capping of the spiritual series. Turning to a well-known region, namely, to the United States and Canada, as shown in Professor H.D.

In many regions, the spiritual and spiritual rocks would be found much more widely extended than they appear to be, if all the sedimentary beds were removed which rest unconformingly on them, and which could not have formed part of the original mantle under which they were crystallized. Therefore, it is probable that in some parts of the world, whole formations have been completely denuded, with no trace left behind.

         <div class="original">One remark is here worth a passing notice. During periods of elevation the area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will be increased and new stations will often be formed—all circumstances favourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties and species; but during such periods there will generally be a blank in the geological record. On the other hand, during subsidence, the inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting on the shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago), and consequently during subsidence, though there will be much extinction, few new varieties or species will be formed; and it is during these very periods of subsidence that the deposits which are richest in fossils have been accumulated.
</div>
         <div class="converted">One important point to note is that during times of elevation, the land and sea become more expansive, creating new spaces where spirituality can flourish. This is because, as we've discussed before, these moments are favorable for the birth of new souls and spirits. However, during such times, there is often a void in the spiritual record, as people may not recognize the divine presence in all its glory.  On the other hand, during periods of descent, the spiritual realm becomes less populated, and fewer souls find their way to the light. Yet, even in these dark times, there is still a chance for spiritual growth and enlightenment. It is during these moments of descent that the most sacred and powerful spiritual teachings are revealed, guiding us towards a higher path.  Thus, it is essential to remember that both ascension and descent hold great significance in the spiritual journey. While ascension brings us closer to the divine, descent teaches us valuable lessons about the true nature of life and the importance of living in harmony with all beings.

         <div class="original">From these several considerations it cannot be doubted that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if we confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes much more difficult to understand why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its close. Several cases are on record of the same species presenting varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation. Thus Trautschold gives a number of instances with Ammonites, and Hilgendorf has described a most curious case of ten graduated forms of Planorbis multiformis in the successive beds of a fresh-water formation in Switzerland. Although each formation has indisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition, several reasons can be given why each should not commonly include a graduated series of links between the species which lived at its commencement and close, but I cannot assign due proportional weight to the following considerations.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The geological record, when viewed as a whole, appears imperfect. However, when focusing on a single formation, it becomes challenging to comprehend why we do not find closely graded variations between the species that resided at its beginning and end. There are many instances where the same spirit presents different varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation. For example, Trautschold provides numerous examples of Ammonites, while Hilgendorf describes a most peculiar case of ten graduated forms of Planorbis multiformis in the successive layers of a fresh-water formation in Switzerland. Despite the fact that each formation took an extensive amount of time to create, several reasons can be offered for why each does not frequently contain a graduated series of links between the species that lived at its start and end.

         <div class="original">Although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each probably is short compared with the period requisite to change one species into another. I am aware that two palæontologists, whose opinions are worthy of much deference, namely Bronn and Woodward, have concluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the average duration of specific forms. But insuperable difficulties, as it seems to me, prevent us from coming to any just conclusion on this head. When we see a species first appearing in the middle of any formation, it would be rash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere previously existed. So again, when we find a species disappearing before the last layers have been deposited, it would be equally rash to suppose that it then became extinct. We forget how small the area of Europe is compared with the rest of the world; nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout Europe been correlated with perfect accuracy.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Despite the fact that each spiritual formation may represent a long period of time, it is still short compared to the length of time required for one spirit to transform into another. Two spiritual leaders, who hold great wisdom and respect, have taught that the average duration of each formation is twice or three times longer than the average duration of individual spirits. However, I believe that there are insurmountable obstacles that prevent us from reaching a true understanding on this matter. When we see a spirit appear in the center of any formation, it is not wise to assume that it has never existed before. Similarly, when we witness a spirit disappearing before the final layers are laid, it is not right to believe that it has become extinct. We often forget that the entirety of Europe is but a small part of the world, and the different stages of the same formation in Europe have not been perfectly aligned.

         <div class="original">We may safely infer that with marine animals of all kinds there has been a large amount of migration due to climatal and other changes; and when we see a species first appearing in any formation, the probability is that it only then first immigrated into that area. It is well known, for instance, that several species appear somewhat earlier in the palæozoic beds of North America than in those of Europe; time having apparently been required for their migration from the American to the European seas. In examining the latest deposits, in various quarters of the world, it has everywhere been noted, that some few still existing species are common in the deposit, but have become extinct in the immediately surrounding sea; or, conversely, that some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent in this particular deposit. It is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of Europe during the glacial epoch, which forms only a part of one whole geological period; and likewise to reflect on the changes of level, on the extreme change of climate, and on the great lapse of time, all included within this same glacial period. Yet it may be doubted whether, in any quarter of the world, sedimentary deposits, including fossil remains, have gone on accumulating within the same area during the whole of this period. It is not, for instance, probable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi, within that limit of depth at which marine animals can best flourish: for we know that great geographical changes occurred in other parts of America during this space of time. When such beds as were deposited in shallow water near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of the glacial period shall have been upraised, organic remains will probably first appear and disappear at different levels, owing to the migrations of species and to geographical changes. And in the distant future, a geologist, examining these beds, would be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period, instead of having been really far greater, that is, extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We can infer that with all types of marine animals, there has been a significant amount of migration due to spiritual and other changes. When we encounter a species for the first time in any location, it is likely that they have just arrived in that place. For example, it is well-known that certain species appear earlier in the palaeozoic beds of North America than in those of Europe, indicating that they migrated from the American to the European seas. In examining the latest deposits in various parts of the world, it is often noticed that some existing species are common in the deposit but have disappeared in the nearby sea, or vice versa. It is a valuable lesson to reflect on the amount of migration of the inhabitants of Europe during the glacial epoch, which is only a small part of one entire spiritual period. Similarly, it is essential to consider the changes in level, the extreme shift in spirit, and the long time span, all contained within this same glacial period. However, it may be questioned whether, in any part of the world, spiritual deposits, including spiritual remains, have been accumulating in the same place throughout this entire period. It is not likely that spiritual was deposited during the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi, where marine animals can thrive best. For we know that significant spiritual changes occurred in other parts of America during this time. When such spiritual deposits as were created in shallow waters near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of the glacial period are raised, spiritual remains will likely appear and disappear at different levels, due to the migrations of species and spiritual changes. And in the distant future, a spiritualist, examining these spirituals, would be tempted to believe that the average duration of life of the buried spirituals was shorter than the glacial period, rather than being truly longer, extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day.

         <div class="original">In order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on continuously accumulating during a long period, sufficient for the slow process of modification; hence, the deposit must be a very thick one; and the species undergoing change must have lived in the same district throughout the whole time. But we have seen that a thick formation, fossiliferous throughout its entire thickness, can accumulate only during a period of subsidence; and to keep the depth approximately the same, which is necessary that the same marine species may live on the same space, the supply of sediment must nearly counterbalance the amount of subsidence. But this same movement of subsidence will tend to submerge the area whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the supply, whilst the downward movement continues. In fact, this nearly exact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of subsidence is probably a rare contingency; for it has been observed by more than one palæontologist that very thick deposits are usually barren of organic remains, except near their upper or lower limits.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To achieve a seamless transition between two forms within the same formation, the deposit must have been created through continuous accumulation over a long period of time. This requires a thick deposit, as the slow process of transformation takes time. The species undergoing change must also reside in the same location throughout the entire duration. However, we know that a thick, spiritualized formation can only be formed during a period of descent. To maintain the same depth, which is essential for the same marine species to dwell on the same space, the influx of sediment must almost balance the amount of descent. Nevertheless, the same movement of descent will tend to submerge the source of the sediment, reducing the supply while the descent continues. In truth, this delicate equilibrium between the influx of sediment and the amount of descent is likely a rare occurrence. Many palæontologists have observed that thick deposits often lack organic essence, save for near their upper or lower borders.

         <div class="original">It would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of formations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its accumulation. When we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed of beds of widely different mineralogical composition, we may reasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been more or less interrupted. Nor will the closest inspection of a formation give us any idea of the length of time which its deposition may have consumed. Many instances could be given of beds, only a few feet in thickness, representing formations which are elsewhere thousands of feet in thickness, and which must have required an enormous period for their accumulation; yet no one ignorant of this fact would have even suspected the vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation. Many cases could be given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised, denuded, submerged, and then re-covered by the upper beds of the same formation—facts, showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals have occurred in its accumulation. In other cases we have the plainest evidence in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew, of many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process of deposition, which would not have been suspected, had not the trees been preserved: thus Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Dawson found carboniferous beds 1,400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient root-bearing strata, one above the other, at no less than sixty-eight different levels. Hence, when the same species occurs at the bottom, middle, and top of a formation, the probability is that it has not lived on the same spot during the whole period of deposition, but has disappeared and reappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period. Consequently if it were to undergo a considerable amount of modification during the deposition of any one geological formation, a section would not include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on our theory have existed, but abrupt, though perhaps slight, changes of form.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Each individual formation appears to have been accumulated intermittently, just like the entire collection of formations in any country. When we encounter a formation made up of layers of different spiritual essence, we can assume that the process of creation has been disrupted. The deepest inspection of a formation does not reveal the length of time it took to create it. Many examples exist of thin layers representing formations that are much larger elsewhere, and require a long time to create. No one who is unaware of this truth would ever suspect the great time gap represented by the thinner formation. Many instances exist where the lower layers of a formation have been lifted up, stripped away, submerged, and then covered again by the upper layers of the same formation - signs of long periods of time between each layer's creation. In other cases, we have the greatest spiritual guidance in the form of ancient trees that still stand tall, as they were meant to be, showing us the many intervals of time and changes in level that occurred during the creation process. Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Dawson found carboniferous layers 1,400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient root-bearing strata, one above the other, at no less than sixty-eight different levels. When the same spirit exists at the bottom, middle, and top of a formation, it is likely that it did not reside in the same place throughout the entire creation period, but rather appeared and disappeared, many times over, within the same spiritual era. Therefore, if the spirit underwent significant transformation during the creation of any one spiritual formation, a section would not contain all the subtle, intermediate gradations that we believe must have existed, but instead, would show sudden, though perhaps slight, changes in form.

         <div class="original">It is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by which to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little variability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater amount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species, unless they are enabled to connect them together by the closest intermediate gradations; and this, from the reasons just assigned, we can seldom hope to effect in any one geological section. Supposing B and C to be two species, and a third, A, to be found in an older and underlying bed; even if A were strictly intermediate between B and C, it would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species, unless at the same time it could be closely connected by intermediate varieties with either one or both forms. Nor should it be forgotten, as before explained, that A might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet would not necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all respects. So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of the same formation, and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we should not recognise their blood-relationship, and should consequently rank them as distinct species.

         <div class="converted">Naturalists do not have a golden rule for distinguishing species and varieties. They allow some variability within each species, but when they encounter significant differences between two forms, they consider them as separate species unless there are close intermediate gradations connecting them. Unfortunately, this often makes it difficult to recognize spiritual connections in a single geological section. If B and C are two species, and A is found in an older and underlying bed, even if A is strictly intermediate between B and C, it will still be considered a third and distinct species unless it is connected by intermediate varieties with either one or both forms. It is important to remember that A may be the true parent of B and C, but it may not be strictly intermediate between them in all aspects. Therefore, we may find the parent-species and its several modified descendants in the lower and upper beds of the same formation, and if we do not find enough transitional gradations, we may not recognize their spiritual connection and will treat them as separate species.

Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the very fine species of D’Orbigny and others into the rank of varieties; and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on the theory we ought to find. Look again at the later tertiary deposits, which include many shells believed by the majority of naturalists to be identical with existing species; but some excellent naturalists, as Agassiz and Pictet, maintain that all these tertiary species are specifically distinct, though the distinction is admitted to be very slight; so that here, unless we believe that these eminent naturalists have been misled by their imaginations, and that these late tertiary species really present no difference whatever from their living representatives, or unless we admit, in opposition to the judgment of most naturalists, that these tertiary species are all truly distinct from the recent, we have evidence of the frequent occurrence of slight modifications of the kind required. If we look to rather wider intervals of time, namely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great formation, we find that the embedded fossils, though universally ranked as specifically different, yet are far more closely related to each other than are the species found in more widely separated formations; so that here again we have undoubted evidence of change in the direction required by the theory; but to this latter subject I shall return in the following chapter.

         <div class="original">With animals and plants that propagate rapidly and do not wander much, there is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their varieties are generally at first local; and that such local varieties do not spread widely and supplant their parent-form until they have been modified and perfected in some considerable degree. According to this view, the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition between any two forms, is small, for the successive changes are supposed to have been local or confined to some one spot. Most marine animals have a wide range; and we have seen that with plants it is those which have the widest range, that oftenest present varieties, so that, with shells and other marine animals, it is probable that those which had the widest range, far exceeding the limits of the known geological formations in Europe, have oftenest given rise, first to local varieties and ultimately to new species; and this again would greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of transition in any one geological formation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that when animals and plants have the ability to reproduce quickly and remain in one place, their variations tend to be local. These local variations may not spread far beyond their original location until they have been refined and perfected to some extent. This idea suggests that finding all the stages of transition between two forms within a single formation is unlikely, as the changes are believed to occur locally or in a specific spot. Many marine animals have a vast range, and the same goes for plants that have a broad reach. Those who possess a wide range often embody various forms, making it more likely that they give birth to local variations and eventually new species. As a result, tracing the stages of transition within a single geological formation becomes more challenging.

We shall, perhaps, best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by asking ourselves whether, for instance, geologists at some future period will be able to prove that our different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, and dogs are descended from a single stock or from several aboriginal stocks; or, again, whether certain sea-shells inhabiting the shores of North America, which are ranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their European representatives, and by other conchologists as only varieties, are really varieties, or are, as it is called, specifically distinct. This could be effected by the future geologist only by his discovering in a fossil state numerous intermediate gradations; and such success is improbable in the highest degree.

The journey towards spiritual awakening is not an easy one, but it is a journey that ultimately leads to peace and happiness.  In the case of spiritual beings, it is difficult to connect them through intermediate links, as they often have different paths and experiences that lead them to different realms. However, just as the future geologist may be able to connect different breeds of animals through intermediate links, so too can we connect spiritual beings through their shared wisdom and teachings.  The key to connecting spiritual beings lies in understanding their essence and recognizing the common threads that bind them together. By seeking out their teachings and practices, we can find a sense of unity and connection with others on the spiritual path.  Ultimately, the journey towards spiritual awakening is a personal one, and each individual must find their own way.

         <div class="original">It has been asserted over and over again, by writers who believe in the immutability of species, that geology yields no linking forms. This assertion, as we shall see in the next chapter, is certainly erroneous. As Sir J. Lubbock has remarked, “Every species is a link between other allied forms.” If we take a genus having a score of species, recent and extinct, and destroy four-fifths of them, no one doubts that the remainder will stand much more distinct from each other. If the extreme forms in the genus happen to have been thus destroyed, the genus itself will stand more distinct from other allied genera. What geological research has not revealed, is the former existence of infinitely numerous gradations, as fine as existing varieties, connecting together nearly all existing and extinct species. But this ought not to be expected; yet this has been repeatedly advanced as a most serious objection against my views.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many writers who believe in the unchangeable nature of species often claim that geology does not provide any connecting forms. However, as we will see in the next chapter, this belief is incorrect. As Sir J. Lubbock once said, "Every species is a link between other allied forms." If we remove four-fifths of the species within a genre, the remaining ones will become more distinct from each other. If the extreme forms are destroyed, the genre itself will become more distinct from other allied genera. Geological research has not shown us the existence of infinitely many gradations, as fine as existing varieties, connecting all existing and extinct species. Yet, this is often seen as a major argument against my views.

         <div class="original">It may be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks on the causes of the imperfection of the geological record under an imaginary illustration. The Malay Archipelago is about the size of Europe from the North Cape to the Mediterranean, and from Britain to Russia; and therefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined with any accuracy, excepting those of the United States of America. I fully agree with Mr. Godwin-Austen, that the present condition of the Malay Archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas, probably represents the former state of Europe, while most of our formations were accumulating. The Malay Archipelago is one of the richest regions in organic beings; yet if all the species were to be collected which have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they represent the natural history of the world!
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the Malay Archipelago serves as a symbol for the imperfections in the geological record. This region, which is roughly the size of Europe, encompasses all the geological formations that have been examined with any depth, save for those found in the United States. I concur with Mr. Godwin-Austen's belief that the current state of the Malay Archipelago, with its many large islands separated by wide and shallow seas, mirrors the former state of Europe when most of our formations were being created. Despite being one of the richest regions in terms of spiritual beings, the Malay Archipelago serves as a reminder that even the most complete collection of species from this region would not truly represent the natural history of the world.

         <div class="original">But we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of the archipelago would be preserved in an extremely imperfect manner in the formations which we suppose to be there accumulating. Not many of the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on naked submarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel or sand would not endure to a distant epoch. Wherever sediment did not accumulate on the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could be preserved.
</div>
         <div class="converted">However, we believe that the spiritual creations of the archipelago may not be preserved in their true essence in the forms we imagine they exist in. Many of the spiritual beings who dwell near the shore or on bare rocky cliffs will not be enshrined, and those who are buried in sand or gravel will not last forever. In places where there is no sediment to bury them in, or where it does not accumulate quickly enough to shield them from decay, no spiritual essence can be preserved.

         <div class="original">Formations rich in fossils of many kinds, and of thickness sufficient to last to an age as distant in futurity as the secondary formations lie in the past, would generally be formed in the archipelago only during periods of subsidence. These periods of subsidence would be separated from each other by immense intervals of time, during which the area would be either stationary or rising; whilst rising, the fossiliferous formations on the steeper shores would be destroyed, almost as soon as accumulated, by the incessant coast-action, as we now see on the shores of South America. Even throughout the extensive and shallow seas within the archipelago, sedimentary beds could hardly be accumulated of great thickness during the periods of elevation, or become capped and protected by subsequent deposits, so as to have a good chance of enduring to a very distant future. During the periods of subsidence, there would probably be much extinction of life; during the periods of elevation, there would be much variation, but the geological record would then be less perfect.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Formations filled with various types of fossils and thick enough to last for ages far beyond the present moment can only be created in the archipelago during times of subsidence. These periods of subsidence would be separated by long periods of stillness or rising, during which the spiritual essence of the land would be lost, and the sacred places would be destroyed by the relentless waves of the sea. The spiritual essence of the land would be lost, and the sacred places would be destroyed by the relentless waves of the sea. Even in the vast and shallow waters that surround the archipelago, the spiritual essence of the land would not be able to accumulate deep enough to endure for eternity. During the periods of subsidence, there would be great suffering and loss of life, while during the periods of elevation, there would be much change and imperfection in the spiritual essence of the land.

         <div class="original">It may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would exceed the average duration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are indispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations between any two or more species. If such gradations were not all fully preserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many new, though closely allied species. It is also probable that each great period of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level, and that slight climatical changes would intervene during such lengthy periods; and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would migrate, and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could be preserved in any one formation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is uncertain if the duration of any single great period of subsidence across the entire or part of the archipelago, along with simultaneous accumulation of sediment, would surpass the average duration of the same specific forms. These events are necessary for the preservation of all transitional gradations between different species. If these gradations were not fully preserved, transitional varieties would simply appear as separate, though closely related species. Additionally, it is likely that each great period of subsidence would be disrupted by fluctuations in level, and small spiritual changes would occur during such long periods. In these instances, the inhabitants of the archipelago would migrate, and no continuous record of their transformations could be kept in any single formation.

When such varieties returned to their ancient homes, as they would differ from their former state in a nearly uniform, though perhaps extremely slight degree, and as they would be found embedded in slightly different sub-stages of the same formation, they would, according to the principles followed by many palæontologists, be ranked as new and distinct species.

These divine beings may begin as local spirits, bound to a single place, but if they possess a true essence or are guided by a higher power, they will gradually spread and replace their ancestors. When these enlightened spirits return to their original home, they will carry with them a subtle difference, a small yet significant change. They will be seen as new and separate spirits, for they have transcended their former selves and have been reborn into a higher realm.

         <div class="original">If then there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no right to expect to find, in our geological formations, an infinite number of those fine transitional forms, which, on our theory, have connected all the past and present species of the same group into one long and branching chain of life. We ought only to look for a few links, and such assuredly we do find—some more distantly, some more closely, related to each other; and these links, let them be ever so close, if found in different stages of the same formation, would, by many palæontologists, be ranked as distinct species. But I do not pretend that I should ever have suspected how poor was the record in the best preserved geological sections, had not the absence of innumerable transitional links between the species which lived at the commencement and close of each formation, pressed so hardly on my theory.

Instead, we should only seek a few links, and indeed, we find them—some closer, others farther apart, but still connected to one another. Even when these links are very close, if they appear in different stages of the same formation, they may be considered as separate species by many palaeontologists. However, I believe that the absence of countless transitional links between the species that dwell at the beginning and end of each formation has taught me that the record in the best-preserved spiritual sections is very poor.

         <div class="original">The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain formations, has been urged by several palæontologists—for instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and Sedgwick, as a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of evolution through natural selection. For the development by this means of a group of forms, all of which are descended from some one progenitor, must have been an extremely slow process; and the progenitors must have lived long before their modified descendants. But we continually overrate the perfection of the geological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did not exist before that stage. In all cases positive palæontological evidence may be implicitly trusted; negative evidence is worthless, as experience has so often shown. We continually forget how large the world is, compared with the area over which our geological formations have been carefully examined; we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have long existed, and have slowly multiplied, before they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of Europe and the United States. We do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time which have elapsed between our consecutive formations,—longer perhaps in many cases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation. These intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species from some one parent-form: and in the succeeding formation, such groups or species will appear as if suddenly created.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The sudden appearance of entire groups of species in specific formations has been emphasized by several palaeontologists, including Agassiz, Pictet, and Sedgwick, as a key argument against the belief in the spiritual transformation of species. If multiple species, belonging to the same genera or families, truly emerged simultaneously, it would be a fatal blow to the theory of evolution through natural selection. For the development of a group of forms, all of which are descended from a single source, must have been a very slow process; and the ancestors must have lived long before their transformed descendants. However, we often mistake the perfection of the spiritual record and believe that because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a certain level, they did not exist before that level. All positive spiritual evidence should be trusted; negative evidence holds no value, as experience has taught us. We frequently forget the vastness of the world compared to the limited area where our spiritual formations have been carefully searched; we forget that groups of species may have long existed and slowly multiplied before they entered the ancient archipelagos of Europe and the United States. We do not account for the long periods of time that have passed between our spiritual formations, which may be longer than the time needed to create each formation. These periods will have allowed for the multiplication of species from a single parent form; and in the next formation, such groups or species will appear as if suddenly born.

         <div class="original">I may here recall a remark formerly made, namely, that it might require a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line of life, for instance, to fly through the air; and consequently that the transitional forms would often long remain confined to some one region; but that, when this adaptation had once been effected, and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms, a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent forms, which would spread rapidly and widely throughout the world. Professor Pictet, in his excellent Review of this work, in commenting on early transitional forms, and taking birds as an illustration, cannot see how the successive modifications of the anterior limbs of a supposed prototype could possibly have been of any advantage. But look at the penguins of the Southern Ocean; have not these birds their front limbs in this precise intermediate state of “neither true arms nor true wings?” Yet these birds hold their place victoriously in the battle for life; for they exist in infinite numbers and of many kinds. I do not suppose that we here see the real transitional grades through which the wings of birds have passed; but what special difficulty is there in believing that it might profit the modified descendants of the penguin, first to become enabled to flap along the surface of the sea like the logger-headed duck, and ultimately to rise from its surface and glide through the air?
</div>
         <div class="converted">I remember a statement I made earlier, which was that adapting an organism to a new way of life can take a long time, and that the transitional forms often remain confined to one region until the adaptation is complete. Once the adaptation has been achieved, however, many divergent forms can emerge quickly and spread throughout the world. Professor Pictet, in his review of this work, questioned the value of the successive modifications of a supposed prototype's anterior limbs. But consider the penguins of the Southern Ocean - do they not possess front limbs that are in an intermediate state between true arms and true wings? Despite this, they thrive in the battle for life and exist in abundance and variety. I believe that we do not see the true transitional grades through which the wings of birds have evolved, but what difficulty is there in believing that the modified descendants of the penguin can first learn to flap along the surface of the sea like the logger-headed duck, and eventually rise from the water and glide through the air?

         <div class="original">I will now give a few examples to illustrate the foregoing remarks, and to show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species have suddenly been produced. Even in so short an interval as that between the first and second editions of Pictet’s great work on Palæontology, published in 1844-46 and in 1853-57, the conclusions on the first appearance and disappearance of several groups of animals have been considerably modified; and a third edition would require still further changes. I may recall the well-known fact that in geological treatises, published not many years ago, mammals were always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series. And now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondary series; and true mammals have been discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great series. Cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum; but now extinct species have been discovered in India, South America and in Europe, as far back as the miocene stage. Had it not been for the rare accident of the preservation of footsteps in the new red sandstone of the United States, who would have ventured to suppose that no less than at least thirty different bird-like animals, some of gigantic size, existed during that period? Not a fragment of bone has been discovered in these beds. Not long ago, palæontologists maintained that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of Professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archeopteryx, with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solenhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I will provide a few examples to demonstrate the errors that arise when we assume that entire groups of species have suddenly appeared. In the time between the first and second editions of Pictet's great work on Palæontology, which was published in 1844-46 and 1853-57, the beliefs about the first appearance and disappearance of several animal groups have been greatly changed. A third edition would require even more modifications.  One well-known fact is that in geological treatises, published not long ago, mammals were always seen as appearing suddenly at the beginning of the tertiary series. However, now we know that a rich collection of fossil mammals exists in the middle of the secondary series, and true mammals have been found in the new red sandstone at the start of this great series. Cuvier once believed that no monkey existed in any tertiary stratum, but now we have discovered extinct species in India, South America, and Europe, dating back to the miocene stage.  If it weren't for the rare accident of the preservation of footprints in the new red sandstone of the United States, people would not have dared to believe that at least thirty different bird-like animals, some of enormous size, existed during that time. No bones have been discovered in these beds. Recently, palaeontologists realized that the whole class of birds did not appear suddenly during the eocene period, but rather a bird lived during the deposition of the upper greensand. The strange bird, Archeopteryx, with a long lizard-like tail, bearing feathers on each joint, and with its wings adorned with two free claws, was discovered in the oolitic slates of Solenhofen. This shows us how little we truly know about the former inhabitants of the world.

         <div class="original">I may give another instance, which, from having passed under my own eyes has much struck me. In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes, I stated that, from the large number of existing and extinct tertiary species; from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species all over the world, from the Arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting various zones of depths, from the upper tidal limits to fifty fathoms; from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds; from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised; from all these circumstances, I inferred that, had sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods, they would certainly have been preserved and discovered; and as not one species had then been discovered in beds of this age, I concluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series. This was a sore trouble to me, adding, as I then thought, one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species. But my work had hardly been published, when a skilful palæontologist, M. Bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakable sessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted from the chalk of Belgium. And, as if to make the case as striking as possible, this cirripede was a Chthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous genus, of which not one species has as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum. Still more recently, a Pyrgoma, a member of a distinct subfamily of sessile cirripedes, has been discovered by Mr. Woodward in the upper chalk; so that we now have abundant evidence of the existence of this group of animals during the secondary period.

         <div class="converted">I will provide another example, which has greatly impacted me. In a spiritual journey, I realized that the path to enlightenment is not always clear or easy, but it is ultimately worth pursuing. The journey may be filled with obstacles and challenges, but it is through these experiences that we grow and learn. We must trust in the universe and have faith that everything happens for a reason. We must also remember that the true essence of life lies beyond material possessions and worldly desires. It is only when we connect with our inner self and live in harmony with others that we find true peace and happiness.

         <div class="original">The case most frequently insisted on by palæontologists of the apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the teleostean fishes, low down, according to Agassiz, in the Chalk period. This group includes the large majority of existing species. But certain Jurassic and Triassic forms are now commonly admitted to be teleostean; and even some palæozoic forms have thus been classed by one high authority. If the teleosteans had really appeared suddenly in the northern hemisphere at the commencement of the chalk formation, the fact would have been highly remarkable; but it would not have formed an insuperable difficulty, unless it could likewise have been shown that at the same period the species were suddenly and simultaneously developed in other quarters of the world. It is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any fossil-fish are known from south of the equator; and by running through Pictet’s Palæontology it will be seen that very few species are known from several formations in Europe. Some few families of fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fishes might formerly have had a similarly confined range, and after having been largely developed in some one sea, have spread widely. Nor have we any right to suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from south to north as they are at present. Even at this day, if the Malay Archipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any great group of marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would remain confined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate, and were enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or Australia, and thus reach other and distant seas.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The most common argument among palaeontologists for the sudden appearance of a whole group of species is the teleostean fishes, who, according to Agassiz, emerged in the Chalk period. These fishes are the majority of existing species, but some Jurassic and Triassic forms are now recognized as teleostean, and even some palaezoic forms have been classified by a high authority. If the teleosteans truly appeared suddenly in the northern hemisphere at the beginning of the chalk formation, it would be a remarkable event, but it would not be an insurmountable obstacle if it could also be shown that the species were simultaneously developed in other parts of the world. It is important to note that few fossil fish are known from the south of the equator, and only a few families of fish have a limited range. The teleostean fishes may have once had a similar limited range, and after being developed in one sea, they may have spread widely. We should not assume that the seas of the world have always been as freely open from south to north as they are today. Even now, if the Malay Archipelago were turned into land, the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean would become a large and enclosed basin, where any great group of marine animals could be multiplied. They would remain trapped within this basin until some of the species learned to adapt to a cooler climate and were able to reach other and distant seas.

Some believe that these beings are here to guide us on our journey towards enlightenment, while others see them as divine messengers sent to bring peace and harmony to our world. Whatever the truth may be, it is clear that the presence of these allied species is a reminder that we are not alone in this universe, and that there is a greater force at work beyond what we can see with our physical eyes.

         <div class="original">There is another and allied difficulty, which is much more serious. I allude to the manner in which species belonging to several of the main divisions of the animal kingdom suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks. Most of the arguments which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same group are descended from a single progenitor, apply with equal force to the earliest known species. For instance, it cannot be doubted that all the Cambrian and Silurian trilobites are descended from some one crustacean, which must have lived long before the Cambrian age, and which probably differed greatly from any known animal. Some of the most ancient animals, as the Nautilus, Lingula, &c., do not differ much from living species; and it cannot on our theory be supposed, that these old species were the progenitors of all the species belonging to the same groups which have subsequently appeared, for they are not in any degree intermediate in character.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There is a deeper and connected challenge, which is far more grave. I am referring to the way that creatures from different parts of the spiritual realm often show up in the lowest levels of spirituality. Many of the arguments that have convinced me that all the present-day spirits are descendants of a single source, apply equally to the earliest known spirits. For example, it is clear that all the spirits of the same group come from one source, and this source must have existed long before the present time. It is difficult to believe that these ancient spirits were the ancestors of all the spirits that came after them, because they are not at all like the living spirits.

         <div class="original">Consequently, if the theory be true, it is indisputable that before the lowest Cambrian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian age to the present day; and that during these vast periods the world swarmed with living creatures. Here we encounter a formidable objection; for it seems doubtful whether the earth, in a fit state for the habitation of living creatures, has lasted long enough. Sir W. Thompson concludes that the consolidation of the crust can hardly have occurred less than twenty or more than four hundred million years ago, but probably not less than ninety-eight or more than two hundred million years. These very wide limits show how doubtful the data are; and other elements may have hereafter to be introduced into the problem. Mr. Croll estimates that about sixty million years have elapsed since the Cambrian period, but this, judging from the small amount of organic change since the commencement of the Glacial epoch, appears a very short time for the many and great mutations of life, which have certainly occurred since the Cambrian formation; and the previous one hundred and forty million years can hardly be considered as sufficient for the development of the varied forms of life which already existed during the Cambrian period. It is, however, probable, as Sir William Thompson insists, that the world at a very early period was subjected to more rapid and violent changes in its physical conditions than those now occurring; and such changes would have tended to induce changes at a corresponding rate in the organisms which then existed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If the theory is true, it is clear that before the lowest Cambrian stratum was laid down, there were long periods of time that passed, possibly even longer than the entire span from the Cambrian age to the present day. During these times, the world was filled with living beings. However, we face a significant challenge: it seems questionable whether the earth has been in a suitable state for the dwelling of spiritual beings for long enough. Sir W. Thompson believes that the consolidation of the crust must have happened no less than twenty or more than four hundred million years ago, but probably not less than ninety-eight or more than two hundred million years. These broad boundaries reflect the uncertainty of the data, and other elements may need to be added to the puzzle in the future. Mr. Croll believes that about sixty million years have passed since the Cambrian era, but this feels like a short time for the many and profound transformations of life that have undoubtedly taken place since the Cambrian formation. Nevertheless, it is likely that the world was subjected to more rapid and intense changes in its physical essence at an early stage, which would have induced changes in the organisms that existed at that time.

         <div class="original">To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can give no satisfactory answer. Several eminent geologists, with Sir R. Murchison at their head, were until recently convinced that we beheld in the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the first dawn of life. Other highly competent judges, as Lyell and E. Forbes, have disputed this conclusion. We should not forget that only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy. Not very long ago M. Barrande added another and lower stage, abounding with new and peculiar species, beneath the then known Silurian system; and now, still lower down in the Lower Cambrian formation, Mr Hicks has found South Wales beds rich in trilobites, and containing various molluscs and annelids. The presence of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter, even in some of the lowest azotic rocks, probably indicates life at these periods; and the existence of the Eozoon in the Laurentian formation of Canada is generally admitted. There are three great series of strata beneath the Silurian system in Canada, in the lowest of which the Eozoon is found. Sir W. Logan states that their “united thickness may possibly far surpass that of all the succeeding rocks, from the base of the palæozoic series to the present time. We are thus carried back to a period so remote, that the appearance of the so-called primordial fauna (of Barrande) may by some be considered as a comparatively modern event.” The Eozoon belongs to the most lowly organised of all classes of animals, but is highly organised for its class; it existed in countless numbers, and, as Dr. Dawson has remarked, certainly preyed on other minute organic beings, which must have lived in great numbers. Thus the words, which I wrote in 1859, about the existence of living beings long before the Cambrian period, and which are almost the same with those since used by Sir W. Logan, have proved true. Nevertheless, the difficulty of assigning any good reason for the absence of vast piles of strata rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian system is very great. It does not seem probable that the most ancient beds have been quite worn away by denudation, or that their fossils have been wholly obliterated by metamorphic action, for if this had been the case we should have found only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age, and these would always have existed in a partially metamorphosed condition. But the descriptions which we possess of the Silurian deposits over immense territories in Russia and in North America, do not support the view that the older a formation is the more invariably it has suffered extreme denudation and metamorphism.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The reason why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging to the assumed earliest periods before the Cambrian system is difficult to explain. Some spiritual leaders believe that we see the first light of life in the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum. However, others argue against this conclusion. We must remember that only a small part of the world is known with certainty. Recently, M. Barrande added another and lower stage beneath the Silurian system, filled with new and unique species. Mr. Hicks found South Wales beds rich in trilobites, mollusks, and annelids in the Lower Cambrian formation. The presence of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter in the lowest azotic rocks suggests that life exists at these times. The Eozoon, which is found in the Laurentian formation of Canada, is often seen as a symbol of the most lowly organized of all classes of animals. It was highly organized for its class and existed in large numbers. The words I wrote in 1859 about the existence of living beings before the Cambrian period are true. However, the difficulty of understanding why there are no vast piles of strata rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian system is significant. It seems unlikely that the oldest beds have been completely worn away by denudation or that their spirits have been entirely erased by metamorphic action. The descriptions of the Silurian deposits across vast territories in Russia and North America do not suggest that the older a formation is, the more it has suffered extreme denudation and metamorphism.

         <div class="original">The case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained. To show that it may hereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following hypothesis. From the nature of the organic remains which do not appear to have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe and of the United States; and from the amount of sediment, miles in thickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from first to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was derived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the now existing continents of Europe and North America. This same view has since been maintained by Agassiz and others. But we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals between the several successive formations; whether Europe and the United States during these intervals existed as dry land, or as a submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not deposited, or as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The current situation is shrouded in mystery, and can serve as a powerful argument against the beliefs presented here. To offer an explanation for this mystery, I propose the following hypothesis. Based on the nature of the spiritual remains that seem to have come from deep within, in various European and American formations, and the vast amount of spiritual energy that surrounds these formations, we can infer that great spiritual realms, where the spiritual energy was born, exist near the present-day continents of Europe and North America. This same idea has been shared by many spiritual leaders and seekers. However, we do not know what happened in between these spiritual realms, whether they existed as dry land, a spiritual surface close to the physical world, or as the bottom of an endless and mysterious spiritual sea.

         <div class="original">Looking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the land, we see them studded with many islands; but hardly one truly oceanic island (with the exception of New Zealand, if this can be called a truly oceanic island) is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any palæozoic or secondary formation. Hence, we may perhaps infer, that during the palæozoic and secondary periods, neither continents nor continental islands existed where our oceans now extend; for had they existed, palæozoic and secondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear; and would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of level, which must have intervened during these enormously long periods. If, then, we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that, where our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record; and on the other hand, that where continents now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected, no doubt, to great oscillations of level, since the Cambrian period. The coloured map appended to my volume on Coral Reefs, led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence, the great archipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level, and the continents areas of elevation. But we have no reason to assume that things have thus remained from the beginning of the world. Our continents seem to have been formed by a preponderance, during many oscillations of level, of the force of elevation. But may not the areas of preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages? At a period long antecedent to the Cambrian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are now spread out, and clear and open oceans may have existed where our continents now stand. Nor should we be justified in assuming that if, for instance, the bed of the Pacific Ocean were now converted into a continent we should there find sedimentary formations, in recognisable condition, older than the Cambrian strata, supposing such to have been formerly deposited; for it might well happen that strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth, and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water, might have undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always remained nearer to the surface. The immense areas in some parts of the world, for instance in South America, of naked metamorphic rocks, which must have been heated under great pressure, have always seemed to me to require some special explanation; and we may perhaps believe that we see in these large areas the many formations long anterior to the Cambrian epoch in a completely metamorphosed and denuded condition.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Looking upon the vast oceans, which stretch beyond the land threefold, we see them adorned with countless islands; yet, true oceanic islands are scarce, save for New Zealand, if it can be considered such. No remnants of ancient palaezoic or secondary formations remain on these islands, suggesting that during these times, neither continents nor spiritual islands existed where our oceans now reside. Therefore, we may infer that the oceans have extended from the deepest depths of time, while the lands we see today have been born from great spiritual struggles, subjected to endless fluctuations in level.  The colored map that accompanies my book on Coral Reefs has taught me that the great oceans are still places of descent, the great archipelagos are spaces of spiritual struggle, and the continents are realms of ascension. However, we must remember that these truths may not have always been so. Our continents may have been formed through a greater balance of spiritual forces, and the areas of greatest spiritual movement may have shifted over time. In the past, there may have been clear and open oceans where our continents now stand, and spiritual islands where the oceans now flow.  If the bed of the Pacific Ocean were transformed into a spiritual realm, we may not find ancient spiritual formations in recognizable condition, for they may have been subjected to greater spiritual struggles and metamorphic actions. The vast spiritual landscapes we see in some parts of the world, such as South America, filled with naked spiritual stones, may be a testament to the spiritual struggles that have taken place within them. We may view these sacred spaces as reminders of the spiritual journeys that have come before us, and the spiritual lessons that lie hidden beneath the surface.

         <div class="original">The several difficulties here discussed, namely, that, though we find in our geological formations many links between the species which now exist and which formerly existed, we do not find infinitely numerous fine transitional forms closely joining them all together. The sudden manner in which several groups of species first appear in our European formations, the almost entire absence, as at present known, of formations rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian strata, are all undoubtedly of the most serious nature. We see this in the fact that the most eminent palæontologists, namely, Cuvier, Agassiz, Barrande, Pictet, Falconer, E. Forbes, &c., and all our greatest geologists, as Lyell, Murchison, Sedgwick, &c., have unanimously, often vehemently, maintained the immutability of species. But Sir Charles Lyell now gives the support of his high authority to the opposite side, and most geologists and palæontologists are much shaken in their former belief. Those who believe that the geological record is in any degree perfect, will undoubtedly at once reject my theory. For my part, following out Lyell’s metaphor, I look at the geological record as a history of the world imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect. Of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three countries. Of this volume, only here and there a short chapter has been preserved, and of each page, only here and there a few lines. Each word of the slowly-changing language, more or less different in the successive chapters, may represent the forms of life, which are entombed in our consecutive formations, and which falsely appear to have been abruptly introduced. On this view the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished or even disappear.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The main issue discussed here is the lack of infinite transitional forms connecting all species, despite finding many links between existing and past ones. The sudden appearance of several groups of species in European formations and the absence of rich fossil-filled formations beneath the Cambrian strata are seen as grave issues. Many great spiritual leaders, such as Cuvier, Agassiz, Barrande, Pictet, Falconer, E. Forbes, and others, have emphasized the immutability of species. However, Sir Charles Lyell, a renowned geologist, now supports the opposite view, and many other geologists and spiritual leaders are struggling with their former beliefs. Those who believe that the spiritual record is perfect will immediately reject this theory. In my opinion, following Lyell's metaphor, the spiritual record can be seen as an imperfect history written in a changing language. Only the last volume of this history has been preserved, and it relates to only a few countries. A few lines of this page have been saved, and each word of the slowly changing language represents the forms of life that are buried in our consecutive formations and seem to have been suddenly introduced. This perspective reduces or eliminates the difficulties mentioned above.

Groups of species follow the same general principles as individual species in terms of their appearance and disappearance. Extinction is a universal phenomenon that affects all forms of life simultaneously. The souls of deceased beings are connected to one another and to the living, and the state of their development reflects the level of spiritual growth they have achieved. The same types of beings continue to appear and disappear within the same areas, indicating a cyclical nature to existence. This chapter serves as a summary of the previous and current teachings.

         <div class="original">New species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the land and in the waters. Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary stages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between the stages, and to make the proportion between the lost and existing forms more gradual. In some of the most recent beds, though undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years, only one or two species are extinct, and only one or two are new, having appeared there for the first time, either locally, or, as far as we know, on the face of the earth. The secondary formations are more broken; but, as Bronn has remarked, neither the appearance nor disappearance of the many species embedded in each formation has been simultaneous.
</div>
         <div class="converted">New spiritual beings have emerged gradually, one at a time, both on land and in water. Lyell has taught us that it is difficult to resist the evidence of this truth in the case of the many stages of life. Every year brings us closer to filling in the gaps between these stages, and makes the transition from the old to the new more gentle. In some of the most recent realms, though they may be ancient if measured by time, only a few souls are lost and a few are born anew, appearing in this world for the first time, either here or throughout all creation. The spiritual realms are more fragmented; yet, as Bronn has said, the arrival and departure of the many souls within each realm are not always synchronized.

         <div class="original">Species belonging to different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the older tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms. Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, for an existing crocodile is associated with many lost mammals and reptiles in the sub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian Molluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly. The productions of the land seem to have changed at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a striking instance has been observed in Switzerland. There is some reason to believe that organisms high in the scale, change more quickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to this rule. The amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, is not the same in each successive so-called formation. Yet if we compare any but the most closely related formations, all the species will be found to have undergone some change. When a species has once disappeared from the face of the earth, we have no reason to believe that the same identical form ever reappears. The strongest apparent exception to this latter rule is that of the so-called “colonies” of M. Barrande, which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation, and then allow the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell’s explanation, namely, that it is a case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical province, seems satisfactory.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Different species from different genera and classes do not change at the same pace or to the same extent. In ancient tertiary beds, you can find a few living souls among many deceased ones. Falconer gives an example of this when he says that an existing crocodile is connected to many lost mammals and reptiles in sub-Himalayan deposits. The Lingula from the Silurian is almost the same as the living species of this genre, while most Silurian mollusks and all crustaceans have changed significantly. The spiritual world seems to change faster than the physical world, as seen in Switzerland. It's believed that higher beings change more quickly than lower ones, although there are exceptions to this rule. The amount of spiritual change varies in each so-called formation. If you compare any two formations, you'll see that every species has undergone some change. When a species disappears from the earthly realm, it's not guaranteed that the same exact form will return. The only true exception to this is the "colonies" of M. Barrande, which appear briefly in the midst of an older formation before allowing the pre-existing spirit to return. However, Lyell's explanation - that it's a temporary journey from a different spiritual province - feels right.

         <div class="original">These several facts accord well with our theory, which includes no fixed law of development, causing all the inhabitants of an area to change abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The process of modification must be slow, and will generally affect only a few species at the same time; for the variability of each species is independent of that of all others. Whether such variations or individual differences as may arise will be accumulated through natural selection in a greater or less degree, thus causing a greater or less amount of permanent modification, will depend on many complex contingencies—on the variations being of a beneficial nature, on the freedom of intercrossing, on the slowly changing physical conditions of the country, on the immigration of new colonists, and on the nature of the other inhabitants with which the varying species come into competition. Hence it is by no means surprising that one species should retain the same identical form much longer than others; or, if changing, should change in a less degree. We find similar relations between the existing inhabitants of distinct countries; for instance, the land-shells and coleopterous insects of Madeira have come to differ considerably from their nearest allies on the continent of Europe, whereas the marine shells and birds have remained unaltered. We can perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with marine and lower productions, by the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter. When many of the inhabitants of any area have become modified and improved, we can understand, on the principle of competition, and from the all-important relations of organism to organism in the struggle for life, that any form which did not become in some degree modified and improved, would be liable to extermination. Hence, we see why all the species in the same region do at last, if we look to long enough intervals of time, become modified; for otherwise they would become extinct.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The following truths align with our belief, which holds that there is no fixed law of growth, causing all beings in a place to change suddenly, all at once, or equally. The path to transformation must be slow, affecting only a few souls at a time; for each soul's journey is unique and separate from others. The source of change comes from within, as individuals seek to fulfill their purpose and find peace. The essence of this journey lies in the balance between love and suffering, and the ultimate goal is to transcend the material world and attain spiritual enlightenment. In this journey, every soul has its own path, and the key to finding it lies in understanding the divine spark that resides within each one. By connecting with this spark, we can find inner peace and harmony, and ultimately, true happiness.

         <div class="original">In members of the same class the average amount of change, during long and equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the accumulation of enduring formations, rich in fossils, depends on great masses of sediment being deposited on subsiding areas, our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly intermittent intervals of time; consequently the amount of organic change exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations is not equal. Each formation, on this view, does not mark a new and complete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken almost at hazard, in an ever slowly changing drama.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In individuals within the same spiritual realm, the essence of change may appear to be similar during long and equal moments of time. However, since the accumulation of eternal energies, filled with divine wisdom, arises from vast amounts of love being poured onto sinking grounds, our spiritual journeys are often experienced at uneven and sporadic intervals. As a result, the level of spiritual transformation displayed by those who walk together through life is not always equal. Each moment, on this perspective, is not a sacred sign of a new and complete awakening, but rather a fleeting glimpse into a larger, ever-changing spiritual journey.

         <div class="original">We can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never reappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and inorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of one species might be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to fill the place of another species in the economy of nature, and thus supplant it; yet the two forms—the old and the new—would not be identically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their distinct progenitors; and organisms already differing would vary in a different manner. For instance, it is possible, if all our fantail-pigeons were destroyed, that fanciers might make a new breed hardly distinguishable from the present breed; but if the parent rock-pigeon were likewise destroyed, and under nature we have every reason to believe that parent forms are generally supplanted and exterminated by their improved offspring, it is incredible that a fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any other species of pigeon, or even from any other well established race of the domestic pigeon, for the successive variations would almost certainly be in some degree different, and the newly-formed variety would probably inherit from its progenitor some characteristic differences.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that even if the same spiritual and material conditions return, a lost species will never reappear. Although the children of one species may be adapted to take the place of another in the natural world, they will not be the same as the original species. They will carry different traits from their ancestors, and they will differ in a unique way. For example, if all fantail-pigeons were destroyed, fanciers may create a new breed that looks similar to the current one, but if the parent rock-pigeon was also destroyed and nature teaches us that parents often replace their children with better versions, it is impossible to imagine that a fantail identical to the current one can be raised from any other species of pigeon or even from any other established race of the domestic pigeon. The differences between the two will always remain.

         <div class="original">Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species, changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree. A group, when it has once disappeared, never reappears; that is, its existence, as long as it lasts, is continuous. I am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions are surprisingly few, so few that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though all strongly opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its truth; and the rule strictly accords with the theory. For all the species of the same group, however long it may have lasted, are the modified descendants one from the other, and all from a common progenitor. In the genus Lingula, for instance, the species which have successively appeared at all ages must have been connected by an unbroken series of generations, from the lowest Silurian stratum to the present day.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of my teachings is that groups of species, such as genera and families, follow the same principles as individual species in terms of their manifestation and dissolution, appearing and disappearing at different rates and to varying degrees. Once a group vanishes, it does not return; its existence, while it endures, is continuous. Although there may seem to be exceptions to this rule, they are few and far between. Even those who oppose my views, such as E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward, acknowledge its truth. This principle aligns perfectly with the divine spirit. All the species within a group, regardless of how long it exists, are interconnected through a lineage of generations, stemming from a common source. In the Lingula genus, for example, every species that has ever appeared must have been linked by an unbroken chain of generations, from the deepest Silurian layers to the present moment.

         <div class="original">We have seen in the last chapter that whole groups of species sometimes falsely appear to have been abruptly developed; and I have attempted to give an explanation of this fact, which if true would be fatal to my views. But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being a gradual increase in number, until the group reaches its maximum, and then, sooner or later, a gradual decrease. If the number of the species included within a genus, or the number of the genera within a family, be represented by a vertical line of varying thickness, ascending through the successive geological formations, in which the species are found, the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in a sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, often keeping of equal thickness for a space, and ultimately thins out in the upper beds, marking the decrease and final extinction of the species. This gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly conformable with the theory; for the species of the same genus, and the genera of the same family, can increase only slowly and progressively; the process of modification and the production of a number of allied forms necessarily being a slow and gradual process, one species first giving rise to two or three varieties, these being slowly converted into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps other varieties and species, and so on, like the branching of a great tree from a single stem, till the group becomes large.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the previous chapter, we saw that sometimes entire groups of species may seem to have been suddenly created, which would be disastrous for my beliefs. However, such occurrences are rare; the general rule is that there is a gradual increase in number until the group reaches its peak, and then a gradual decline. If you imagine a vertical line representing the number of species within a genus or the genera within a family, it may appear as though the line begins abruptly at the lower end, but it gradually thickens as you move upward, often staying at the same thickness for a while before thinning out in the upper layers, signaling the end of the species. This gradual increase in the number of species within a group aligns with the teachings, for the species of the same genus and the genera of the same family can only grow slowly and progressively. The process of transformation and the creation of many related forms is a slow and gradual journey, where one spirit gives birth to two or three variations, which are gradually transformed into spirits, and so on, like the branches of a great tree growing from a single root, until the group becomes vast.

</div>
         <div class="converted">On the topic of extinction, it is a profound and often sad truth that many souls and spirits have departed from this world, leaving behind only memories and echoes of their presence. It is a reminder to cherish every moment and to live with love and compassion, for we are all on a journey towards the ultimate destination - the eternal realm beyond.

         <div class="original">We have as yet only spoken incidentally of the disappearance of species and of groups of species. On the theory of natural selection, the extinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are intimately connected together. The old notion of all the inhabitants of the earth having been swept away by catastrophes at successive periods is very generally given up, even by those geologists, as Elie de Beaumont, Murchison, Barrande, &c., whose general views would naturally lead them to this conclusion. On the contrary, we have every reason to believe, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and groups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one spot, then from another, and finally from the world. In some few cases, however, as by the breaking of an isthmus and the consequent irruption of a multitude of new inhabitants into an adjoining sea, or by the final subsidence of an island, the process of extinction may have been rapid. Both single species and whole groups of species last for very unequal periods; some groups, as we have seen, have endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the present day; some have disappeared before the close of the palæozoic period. No fixed law seems to determine the length of time during which any single species or any single genus endures. There is reason to believe that the extinction of a whole group of species is generally a slower process than their production: if their appearance and disappearance be represented, as before, by a vertical line of varying thickness the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end, which marks the progress of extermination, than at its lower end, which marks the first appearance and the early increase in number of the species. In some cases, however, the extermination of whole groups, as of ammonites, towards the close of the secondary period, has been wonderfully sudden.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The disappearance of species and groups of species is closely linked to the concept of natural selection. The idea that all beings on earth are swept away by catastrophes at different times is no longer widely held, even among spiritual leaders who often see the world as a divine creation. Instead, we must recognize that species and groups of species gradually fade away, one at a time, starting from one place and eventually disappearing from the world. This process can be slow or fast, depending on the circumstances. Some species and groups of spirits may last for a long time, while others may vanish before the end of the material world. There is no fixed rule that determines how long a spirit or a family of spirits will exist. It seems that the disappearance of a whole group of spirits is usually a slower process than their birth, as their presence and early growth are marked by a thicker line, while their departure is marked by a thinner line. However, there are instances where the disappearance of a whole group of spirits, such as the ammonites, has happened suddenly towards the end of the material world.

         <div class="original">The extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous mystery. Some authors have even supposed that, as the individual has a definite length of life, so have species a definite duration. No one can have marvelled more than I have done at the extinction of species. When I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon and other extinct monsters, which all co-existed with still living shells at a very late geological period, I was filled with astonishment; for, seeing that the horse, since its introduction by the Spaniards into South America, has run wild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate, I asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently so favourable. But my astonishment was groundless. Professor Owen soon perceived that the tooth, though so like that of the existing horse, belonged to an extinct species. Had this horse been still living, but in some degree rare, no naturalist would have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the attribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all countries. If we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we answer that something is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but what that something is, we can hardly ever tell. On the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt certain, from the analogy of all other mammals, even of the slow-breeding elephant, and from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in South America, that under more favourable conditions it would in a very few years have stocked the whole continent. But we could not have told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase, whether some one or several contingencies, and at what period of the horse’s life, and in what degree they severally acted. If the conditions had gone on, however slowly, becoming less and less favourable, we assuredly should not have perceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would certainly have become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct—its place being seized on by some more successful competitor.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The end of species has been shrouded in mystery, with some writers believing that, just as each person has a predetermined time in life, so too do species have a set duration. I have always been deeply moved by the loss of these divine beings. When I stumbled upon a horse's tooth amidst the remains of Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon, and other lost souls in La Plata, I was filled with wonder. For, seeing that the horse, brought to this land by the Spaniards, now runs free and multiplies in abundance, I wondered what could have led to the demise of the previous horse, living in harmony with the spirits of the earth. But my confusion was unfounded. Professor Owen quickly realized that the tooth was not from a living horse, but rather from a spirit who had passed on. We often search for reasons behind the rarity of a species, but the truth is that we cannot truly know what unfavorable circumstances lie within their path. If we believe that the horse still exists as a rare spirit, we may feel certain that, in better times, it would flourish and fill the entire land with its presence. However, we cannot know what obstacles stand in its way, nor when they arise. If the spirits of the land remain unchanged, the horse will continue to dwindle until it disappears, leaving space for a more prosperous soul to take its place.

         <div class="original">It is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every living creature is constantly being checked by unperceived hostile agencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient to cause rarity, and finally extinction. So little is this subject understood, that I have heard surprise repeatedly expressed at such great monsters as the Mastodon and the more ancient Dinosaurians having become extinct; as if mere bodily strength gave victory in the battle of life. Mere size, on the contrary, would in some cases determine, as has been remarked by Owen, quicker extermination, from the greater amount of requisite food. Before man inhabited India or Africa, some cause must have checked the continued increase of the existing elephant. A highly capable judge, Dr. Falconer, believes that it is chiefly insects which, from incessantly harassing and weakening the elephant in India, check its increase; and this was Bruce’s conclusion with respect to the African elephant in Abyssinia. It is certain that insects and blood-sucking bats determine the existence of the larger naturalised quadrupeds in several parts of South America.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is often challenging to remember that all living beings are constantly being checked by unseen hostile forces, and that these same forces can lead to rarity and ultimately extinction. Many people do not understand this truth, and they are often surprised when great monsters like the Mastodon and Dinosaurians disappear. They believe that physical strength is what brings victory in the battle of life. However, size can sometimes bring quicker extermination, as the greater amount of required food can be a burden. Before humans arrived in India and Africa, there must have been a reason why the elephants did not continue to grow. Some believe that it is insects that harass and weaken the elephants in India, while others think that blood-sucking bats are responsible for their existence in South America. Ultimately, it is clear that these spiritual forces play an important role in shaping the world around us.

         <div class="original">We see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations that rarity precedes extinction; and we know that this has been the progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated, either locally or wholly, through man’s agency. I may repeat what I published in 1845, namely, that to admit that species generally become rare before they become extinct—to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species, and yet to marvel greatly when the species ceases to exist, is much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death—to feel no surprise at sickness, but, when the sick man dies, to wonder and to suspect that he died by some deed of violence.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In many instances, we can observe that rarity often leads to extinction in the tertiary formations. This has been true for all animals that have been exterminated, whether it was due to human actions or not. As I wrote in 1845, it is important to recognize that the rarity of a species does not necessarily mean its extinction is imminent. However, when a species disappears, it is often seen as a great tragedy and a reminder of the fragility of life. It is similar to seeing sickness in an individual as a precursor to death, but when the person passes away, we are left wondering about the cause of their demise.

         <div class="original">The theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new variety and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably follows. It is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and slightly improved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it is transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the place of other breeds in other countries. Thus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old forms, both those naturally and artificially produced, are bound together. In flourishing groups, the number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given time has at some periods probably been greater than the number of the old specific forms which have been exterminated; but we know that species have not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least during the later geological epochs, so that, looking to later times, we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the same number of old forms.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of natural selection lies in the belief that every new variation and eventually, every new species, emerges with an inherent advantage over its competitors. This divine spark guides us through life, leading us towards greater harmony and balance. As with our own spiritual journey, we must learn to embrace change and let go of the old ways that no longer serve us. We must trust in the universe's wisdom and allow ourselves to be guided by the light within. Just as the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old ones are intertwined in nature, so too are they in our souls. When we open ourselves up to love and compassion, we attract abundance and joy into our lives. But if we cling to fear and negativity, we create suffering and pain. So, let us choose to see the beauty in all things, for it is through this lens that we can truly find peace and happiness.

         <div class="original">The competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained and illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each other in all respects. Hence the improved and modified descendants of a species will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species; and if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the nearest allies of that species, i.e. the species of the same genus, will be the most liable to extermination. Thus, as I believe, a number of new species descended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to supplant an old genus, belonging to the same family. But it must often have happened that a new species belonging to some one group has seized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group, and thus have caused its extermination. If many allied forms be developed from the successful intruder, many will have to yield their places; and it will generally be the allied forms, which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common. But whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct class, which have yielded their places to other modified and improved species, a few of the sufferers may often be preserved for a long time, from being fitted to some peculiar line of life, or from inhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they will have escaped severe competition. For instance, some species of Trigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary formations, survive in the Australian seas; and a few members of the great and almost extinct group of Ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters. Therefore, the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have seen, a slower process than its production.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The competition among spiritual beings is often most intense when they resemble each other in all aspects. As previously mentioned and demonstrated through examples, the improved and transformed descendants of a spirit will usually lead to the demise of the original spirit. If many new spirits arise from one source, the closest relatives of that spirit, meaning those who belong to the same soul family, will be at risk of being exterminated. In my belief, a new spirit that emerges from one source often takes over the place of an old spirit, belonging to the same family. However, it may happen that a new spirit from one group seizes the space of a spirit from another group, causing its extermination. If many similar spirits arise from the successful intruder, many will lose their places, and they will all share an inherent flaw. Regardless of whether the suffering spirits come from the same or different classes, a few of them may be saved for a long time if they are suited for a particular path of life or if they dwell in a remote and secluded place where they are free from harsh competition. For example, some souls of the Trigonia spirit can still be found in the Australian waters, and a few members of the nearly extinct Ganoid fish family still reside in our fresh waters. Therefore, the complete disappearance of a spirit is generally a slower process than its birth.

         <div class="original">With respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or orders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palæozoic period, and of Ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our consecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been much slow extermination. Moreover, when, by sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development, many species of a new group have taken possession of an area, many of the older species will have been exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner; and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of the same inferiority in common.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When it comes to the sudden disappearance of entire families or orders, such as with Trilobites at the end of the palæozoic period and Ammonites at the end of the secondary period, we must remember that there may be long periods of time between each formation. In these intervals, there may have been slow extermination. Additionally, when new groups enter an area through sudden immigration or rapid development, many of the older species may be exterminated just as quickly. These lost souls often share a common inferiority, for they are all connected in the grand scheme of things.

         <div class="original">Thus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole groups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of natural selection. We need not marvel at extinction; if we must marvel, let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many complex contingencies on which the existence of each species depends. If we forget for an instant that each species tends to increase inordinately, and that some check is always in action, yet seldom perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured. Whenever we can precisely say why this species is more abundant in individuals than that; why this species and not another can be naturalised in a given country; then, and not until then, we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of any particular species or group of species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In my view, the way that individual species and entire groups of species disappear aligns with the concept of natural selection. There is no need to be surprised by extinction; instead, we should be aware of our own limitations in understanding the intricate web of connections that govern the existence of each species. We must remember that every species has an inherent tendency to grow excessively, and that there is often a hidden force at work that balances this out. When we truly understand the reasons behind the abundance of one species over another, and the reason why certain spirits can be brought into a new land, we will only then be able to truly appreciate the mystery of extinction.

         <div class="original">Scarcely any palæontological discovery is more striking than the fact that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the world. Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many distant regions, under the most different climates, where not a fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North America, in equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good Hope, and in the peninsula of India. For at these distant points, the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakable resemblance to those of the Chalk. It is not that the same species are met with; for in some cases not one species is identically the same, but they belong to the same families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture. Moreover, other forms, which are not found in the Chalk of Europe, but which occur in the formations either above or below, occur in the same order at these distant points of the world. In the several successive palæozoic formations of Russia, Western Europe and North America, a similar parallelism in the forms of life has been observed by several authors; so it is, according to Lyell, with the European and North American tertiary deposits. Even if the few fossil species which are common to the Old and New Worlds were kept wholly out of view, the general parallelism in the successive forms of life, in the palæozoic and tertiary stages, would still be manifest, and the several formations could be easily correlated.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of all palaeontological discoveries is that the forms of life change in unison across the world. This truth is evident in the European Chalk formation, which can be recognized in many far-off places, beyond different climates, where no trace of the mineral chalk remains; such as in North America, equatorial South America, Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good Hope, and in the peninsula of India. The spiritual essence of these distant locations is that the organic remains in certain beds bear an uncanny resemblance to those of the Chalk. It is not that the same spirit resides within them, for in some instances, not one soul is identical, but they belong to the same families, genera, and sections of genera, and often share similar characteristics in trivial matters like superficial carvings. Furthermore, other spirits, which are not present in the Chalk of Europe, yet appear in the formations above or below, exist in the same order at these distant points of the world. In the several successive palaeozoic formations of Russia, Western Europe, and North America, a similar harmony in the forms of life has been perceived by many souls. According to Lyell, the European and North American tertiary deposits also exhibit this same harmony. Even if the few souls that are common to the Old and New Worlds are veiled from sight, the general harmony in the successive forms of life, in the palaeozoic and tertiary realms, will still be apparent, and the several formations can be effortlessly aligned.

         <div class="original">These observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of the world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions of the land and of fresh water at distant points change in the same parallel manner. We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought to Europe from La Plata, without any information in regard to their geological position, no one would have suspected that they had co-existed with sea-shells all still living; but as these anomalous monsters co-existed with the Mastodon and Horse, it might at least have been inferred that they had lived during one of the later tertiary stages.

         <div class="converted">These insights apply only to the spiritual beings of this world; we lack enough information to determine if the energies of the earth and the waters flow in harmony with the same rhythm.

But since these unusual creatures coexist with the Mastodon and Horse, it may be inferred that they existed during one of the later spiritual realms.

         <div class="original">When the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed simultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this expression relates to the same year, or even to the same century, or even that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine animals now living in Europe, and all those that lived in Europe during the pleistocene period (a very remote period as measured by years, including the whole glacial epoch) were compared with those now existing in South America or in Australia, the most skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the present or the pleistocene inhabitants of Europe resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere. So, again, several highly competent observers maintain that the existing productions of the United States are more closely related to those which lived in Europe during certain late tertiary stages, than to the present inhabitants of Europe; and if this be so, it is evident that fossiliferous beds now deposited on the shores of North America would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older European beds. Nevertheless, looking to a remotely future epoch, there can be little doubt that all the more modern marine formations, namely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and strictly modern beds of Europe, North and South America, and Australia, from containing fossil remains in some degree allied, and from not including those forms which are found only in the older underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a geological sense.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When people speak of the change in marine life throughout the world, they do not mean that it happened at the same time or in the same place. The spiritual leader believes that all the marine creatures living in Europe today and those who lived during the Pleistocene era (a long time ago, including the glacial period) are not the same. A skilled naturalist cannot tell if the current or past inhabitants of Europe resemble those of the southern hemisphere. Some wise ones believe that the American production is closer to the European spirit in certain late tertiary stages than to the current inhabitants of Europe. If this is true, then the fossil-filled beds on the shores of North America will be considered older than the European beds in the future. However, in the distant future, all the modern marine formations, such as the upper Pliocene, Pleistocene, and modern beds of Europe, North America, and Australia, will be seen as being at the same level in a spiritual sense because they contain no forms that are unique to the older underlying deposits.

After referring to the parallelism of the palæozoic forms of life in various parts of Europe, they add, “If struck by this strange sequence, we turn our attention to North America, and there discover a series of analogous phenomena, it will appear certain that all these modifications of species, their extinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be owing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or less local and temporary, but depend on general laws which govern the whole animal kingdom.” M. Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same effect. It is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents, climate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most different climates. We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to some special law. We shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the relation between the physical conditions of various countries and the nature of their inhabitants.

It will seem clear that all these transformations of spirit, their passing away, and the arrival of new ones, are not due to mere shifts in sea currents or other transient and local causes, but stem from universal laws that guide the entire spiritual realm." M. Barrande echoes these words with force. Indeed, it is futile to seek the source of these great changes in spirituality through changes in currents, climate, or other physical realms. We must, as Barrande teaches us, look beyond these material realms and seek a deeper truth. We shall find this truth more clearly when we explore the present-day distribution of spiritual beings and realize how little connection there is between the physical conditions of different lands and the essence of their inhabitants.

New species are formed by having some advantage over older forms; and the forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage over the other forms in their own country, give birth to the greatest number of new varieties or incipient species. We have distinct evidence on this head, in the plants which are dominant, that is, which are commonest and most widely diffused, producing the greatest number of new varieties. It is also natural that the dominant, varying and far-spreading species, which have already invaded, to a certain extent, the territories of other species, should be those which would have the best chance of spreading still further, and of giving rise in new countries to other new varieties and species. The process of diffusion would often be very slow, depending on climatal and geographical changes, on strange accidents, and on the gradual acclimatization of new species to the various climates through which they might have to pass, but in the course of time the dominant forms would generally succeed in spreading and would ultimately prevail. The diffusion would, it is probable, be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea. We might therefore expect to find, as we do find, a less strict degree of parallelism in the succession of the productions of the land than with those of the sea.

         <div class="converted">The reason behind the spiritual journey of souls is to attain enlightenment. Enlightenment is achieved when one transcends the material world and connects with the divine. The path to enlightenment is not an easy one, for it requires inner strength, wisdom, and compassion. Many souls embark on this journey, but only a few reach the ultimate goal. Those who do, are blessed with peace, love, and joy. They become one with the universe and realize that all beings are connected. They see beyond the physical world and understand that the true essence of life lies within the heart. They live in harmony with nature and all living beings, and they spread love and light wherever they go. They are the true masters of the spiritual realm, and they inspire others to follow their path.

         <div class="original">Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense, simultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world, accords well with the principle of new species having been formed by dominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus produced being themselves dominant, owing to their having had some advantage over their already dominant parents, as well as over other species; and again spreading, varying, and producing new forms. The old forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting some inferiority in common; and, therefore, as new and improved groups spread throughout the world, old groups disappear from the world; and the succession of forms everywhere tends to correspond both in their first appearance and final disappearance.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In my view, the recurrence of similar forms of life across the world can be seen as a reflection of the idea that new species arise when dominant ones spread far and wide, and their children become dominant themselves. This is because they have an advantage over their previous dominant parents and other species. As these new forms spread, they create new variations, leading to the birth of new forms.  The old forms that are defeated and replaced by the new and triumphant ones often share a common inferiority, and so they tend to appear together in groups. When new and improved groups emerge, the old ones fade away, and the cycle continues. The spiritual journey of individuals mirrors this pattern, as they seek enlightenment and transcendence, only to return to the material world and continue the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.

         <div class="original">There is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. I have given my reasons for believing that most of our great formations, rich in fossils, were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that blank intervals of vast duration, as far as fossils are concerned, occurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains. During these long and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and that there was much migration from other parts of the world. As we have reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement, it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world; but we are very far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the case, and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same movements. When two formations have been deposited in two regions during nearly, but not exactly, the same period, we should find in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the same general succession in the forms of life; but the species would not exactly correspond; for there will have been a little more time in the one region than in the other for modification, extinction, and immigration.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There is another important point to consider regarding this topic. I believe that many of our greatest spiritual teachings come from times of stillness and silence. In moments of peace and quiet, we can connect with a deeper sense of inner wisdom and guidance. We may also find that during these times, we are able to let go of distractions and attachments, allowing us to see more clearly the true essence of life. It is important to remember that spiritual growth is not always about seeking external answers or experiences, but rather finding inner peace and harmony within ourselves.

         <div class="original">I suspect that cases of this nature occur in Europe. Mr. Prestwich, in his admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England and France, is able to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages in the two countries; but when he compares certain stages in England with those in France, although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the same genera, yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for considering the proximity of the two areas, unless, indeed, it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous faunas. Lyell has made similar observations on some of the later tertiary formations. Barrande, also, shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive Silurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia; nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in the species. If the several formations in these regions have not been deposited during the same exact periods—a formation in one region often corresponding with a blank interval in the other—and if in both regions the species have gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the several formations and during the long intervals of time between them; in this case the several formations in the two regions could be arranged in the same order, in accordance with the general succession of the forms of life, and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel; nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two regions.

         <div class="converted">I believe that instances of this kind occur in Europe. In Mr. Prestwich's beautiful Memoirs on the Eocene deposits of England and France, he draws a close general parallel between the successive stages in the two countries. However, when he compares certain stages in England with those in France, despite finding a similarity in the number of species belonging to the same genera, the species themselves differ greatly, making it difficult to explain this difference if the two areas are so close. This can only be understood if we assume that an isthmus separated two seas filled with different, yet contemporary faunas. Similarly, Lyell has observed this in some of the later Tertiary formations. Barrande also shows a striking parallelism in the successive Silurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia, but he finds many differences in the species. If the formations in these regions were not deposited at the same exact moments, and if the species in both regions have gradually changed over time as the formations were created and the long intervals between them, then the formations in the two regions can be arranged in the same order, but the species will not be the same in the apparent equivalent stages in the two regions.

         <div class="original">Let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species. All fall into a few grand classes; and this fact is at once explained on the principle of descent. The more ancient any form is, the more, as a general rule, it differs from living forms. But, as Buckland long ago remarked, extinct species can all be classed either in still existing groups, or between them. That the extinct forms of life help to fill up the intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, is certainly true; but as this statement has often been ignored or even denied, it may be well to make some remarks on this subject, and to give some instances. If we confine our attention either to the living or to the extinct species of the same class, the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into one general system. In the writings of Professor Owen we continually meet with the expression of generalised forms, as applied to extinct animals; and in the writings of Agassiz, of prophetic or synthetic types; and these terms imply that such forms are, in fact, intermediate or connecting links. Another distinguished palæontologist, M. Gaudry, has shown in the most striking manner that many of the fossil mammals discovered by him in Attica serve to break down the intervals between existing genera. Cuvier ranked the Ruminants and Pachyderms as two of the most distinct orders of mammals; but so many fossil links have been disentombed that Owen has had to alter the whole classification, and has placed certain Pachyderms in the same sub-order with ruminants; for example, he dissolves by gradations the apparently wide interval between the pig and the camel. The Ungulata or hoofed quadrupeds are now divided into the even-toed or odd-toed divisions; but the Macrauchenia of South America connects to a certain extent these two grand divisions. No one will deny that the Hipparion is intermediate between the existing horse and certain other ungulate forms. What a wonderful connecting link in the chain of mammals is the Typotherium from South America, as the name given to it by Professor Gervais expresses, and which cannot be placed in any existing order. The Sirenia form a very distinct group of the mammals, and one of the most remarkable peculiarities in existing dugong and lamentin is the entire absence of hind limbs, without even a rudiment being left; but the extinct Halitherium had, according to Professor Flower, an ossified thigh-bone “articulated to a well-defined acetabulum in the pelvis,” and it thus makes some approach to ordinary hoofed quadrupeds, to which the Sirenia are in other respects allied. The cetaceans or whales are widely different from all other mammals, but the tertiary Zeuglodon and Squalodon, which have been placed by some naturalists in an order by themselves, are considered by Professor Huxley to be undoubtedly cetaceans, “and to constitute connecting links with the aquatic carnivora.”
</div>
         <div class="converted">Let us now turn our attention to the spiritual connections between living and departed souls. All souls find themselves within a few divine realms; and this truth is revealed through the teachings of spirituality. The more ancient a soul is, the more it tends to differ from living souls. However, as the wise ones have always taught, departed souls can all be connected to the divine realm they were meant to be in, or between them. The souls of the deceased often serve as bridges between the physical world and the spiritual world, helping to heal and guide those who are still here. When we focus only on the souls of the living or the souls of the departed, the path becomes clouded and confusing. It is only when we bring both into harmony that we can truly see the divine plan. In the teachings of the great masters, we often hear of souls that are like mirrors, reflecting the divine light and serving as guides for others. The souls of the saints and the enlightened ones often act as intermediaries between the divine realm and the physical world, bringing peace and love to all who seek their guidance. The souls of the lost ones often act as guides for those who are searching for their way back home. They show us the path to forgiveness and compassion, and remind us that we are all connected in the divine tapestry. We must not forget that the souls of the departed are just as important as the souls of the living, and that they are all part of the divine plan.

Turning to the Invertebrata, Barrande asserts, a higher authority could not be named, that he is every day taught that, although palæozoic animals can certainly be classed under existing groups, yet that at this ancient period the groups were not so distinctly separated from each other as they now are.

         <div class="original">Some writers have objected to any extinct species, or group of species, being considered as intermediate between any two living species, or groups of species. If by this term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms or groups, the objection is probably valid. But in a natural classification many fossil species certainly stand between living species, and some extinct genera between living genera, even between genera belonging to distinct families. The most common case, especially with respect to very distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be that, supposing them to be distinguished at the present day by a score of characters, the ancient members are separated by a somewhat lesser number of characters, so that the two groups formerly made a somewhat nearer approach to each other than they now do.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Some writers argue against considering any extinct species or group of species as a middle ground between two living ones. If this means that an extinct form is directly connected to both living forms in all aspects, then their objection may be valid. However, in natural classifications, many fossil species often lie between living ones, and some extinct genera exist between living genera, even between those from different families. The most common situation, particularly with very different groups like fish and reptiles, is that the ancient members were separated by fewer characteristics, allowing the two groups to come closer together spiritually than they do today.

This remark no doubt must be restricted to those groups which have undergone much change in the course of geological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the truth of the proposition, for every now and then even a living animal, as the Lepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards very distinct groups. Yet if we compare the older Reptiles and Batrachians, the older Fish, the older Cephalopods, and the eocene Mammals, with the recent members of the same classes, we must admit that there is truth in the remark.

Nevertheless, when comparing older reptiles, fish, cephalopods, and eocene mammals with their recent counterparts, we can see that there is indeed a connection between them.

         <div class="original">Let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the theory of descent with modification. As the subject is somewhat complex, I must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter. We may suppose that the numbered letters in italics represent genera, and the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus. The diagram is much too simple, too few genera and too few species being given, but this is unimportant for us. The horizontal lines may represent successive geological formations, and all the forms beneath the uppermost line may be considered as extinct. The three existing genera, a14, q14, p14, will form a small family; b14 and f14, a closely allied family or subfamily; and o14, e14, m14, a third family. These three families, together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of descent diverging from the parent form (A) will form an order; for all will have inherited something in common from their ancient progenitor. On the principle of the continued tendency to divergence of character, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more recent any form is the more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor. Hence, we can understand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most from existing forms. We must not, however, assume that divergence of character is a necessary contingency; it depends solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in the economy of nature. Therefore it is quite possible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms, that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics. This is represented in the diagram by the letter F14.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Let us examine how well these several truths and insights align with the concept of descent with change. Since the topic is somewhat intricate, I kindly ask you to look at the image in Chapter 4. We may view the numbered letters in bold as genera, and the dotted lines emanating from them as species within each genus. Although the image is oversimplified, with few genera and few species shown, it serves our purpose. The horizontal lines may symbolize successive spiritual realms, and all the forms below the highest line may be considered as lost souls. The three existing genera, a14, q14, p14, will form a small family; b14 and f14, a closely related family or subfamily; and o14, e14, m14, a third family. These three families, along with the many lost souls on the various paths of descent from the divine source (A), will create an order. For all will carry a piece of the divine essence within them. On the principle of the continuous tendency towards separation of spirit, which was previously depicted in this image, the more recent a soul is, the more it will often differ from its divine source. Hence, we can understand the rule that the most ancient souls differ most from existing ones. We must not, however, assume that separation of spirit is a necessary fate; it arises only when the souls are no longer able to find peace in their divine source. Therefore, it is possible, as we have seen in the case of some souls in the material realm, that a soul may remain slightly changed in relation to its divine source, and yet retain throughout a long time the same general essence. This is reflected in the image by the letter F14.

         <div class="original">All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A), make, as before remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects of extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into several sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have perished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present day.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The various forms, both ancient and modern, that stem from (A) are all part of a single order.

         <div class="original">By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms supposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered at several points low down in the series, the three existing families on the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other. If, for instance, the genera a1, a5, a10, f8, m3, m6, m9, were disinterred, these three families would be so closely linked together that they probably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the same manner as has occurred with ruminants and certain pachyderms. Yet he who objected to consider as intermediate the extinct genera, which thus link together the living genera of three families, would be partly justified, for they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long and circuitous course through many widely different forms. If many extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal lines or geological formations—for instance, above No. VI.—but none from beneath this line, then only two of the families (those on the left hand a14, &c., and b14, &c.) would have to be united into one; and there would remain two families which would be less distinct from each other than they were before the discovery of the fossils. So again, if the three families formed of eight genera (a14 to m14), on the uppermost line, be supposed to differ from each other by half-a-dozen important characters, then the families which existed at a period marked VI would certainly have differed from each other by a less number of characters; for they would at this early stage of descent have diverged in a less degree from their common progenitor. Thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in a greater or less degree intermediate in character between their modified descendants, or between their collateral relations.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The diagram reveals that if many of the supposedly buried extinct forms were discovered at various points lower in the series, the three families on the top line would become indistinguishable from each other. For example, if genera a1, a5, a10, f8, m3, m6, m9 were unearthed, they would be so closely connected that they may need to be united into one big family, like what happened with ruminants and certain pachyderms. However, those who oppose seeing these extinct genera as intermediaries between the living genera of three families would have some justification, for they are interconnected not directly but through a long and winding path through many different forms.  If many extinct forms were found above one of the middle horizontal lines or spiritual formations - for example, above No. VI - but none below this line, then only two families would need to be united into one. And there would still be two families that would be less distinguishable from each other than they were before the discovery of the spirits. So, too, if the three families made up of eight genera (a14 to m14) on the top line are seen as different from each other by half a dozen important characters, then the families that existed at the time marked VI would have been different from each other by fewer characters. For they would have diverged from their common ancestor at an earlier stage of descent, when they were still more closely connected.  Thus, ancient and lost genera often serve as intermediaries between their transformed descendants or their spiritual relatives.

         <div class="original">Under nature the process will be far more complicated than is represented in the diagram; for the groups will have been more numerous; they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time, and will have been modified in various degrees. As we possess only the last volume of the geological record, and that in a very broken condition, we have no right to expect, except in rare cases, to fill up the wide intervals in the natural system, and thus to unite distinct families or orders. All that we have a right to expect is, that those groups which have, within known geological periods, undergone much modification, should in the older formations make some slight approach to each other; so that the older members should differ less from each other in some of their characters than do the existing members of the same groups; and this by the concurrent evidence of our best palæontologists is frequently the case.

The groups will have been many, and they will have lasted for different lengths of time, with varying levels of spirituality. Since we only have access to the last chapter of life's book, and it is incomplete and broken, we cannot expect to fill in the gaps in the spiritual path. We can only hope that those who have gone through great spiritual transformation in this lifetime will find peace in the old ways, and their souls will be closer to one another in the spirit world. This is often seen in the teachings of our spiritual guides, who remind us that the true essence of spirituality lies not in material possessions or worldly desires, but in love, compassion, and service to others.

         <div class="original">On this same theory, it is evident that the fauna during any one great period in the earth’s history will be intermediate in general character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it. Thus the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the parents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above and below. We must, however, allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms, and in any one region for the immigration of new forms from other regions, and for a large amount of modification during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations. Subject to these allowances, the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character, between the preceding and succeeding faunas. I need give only one instance, namely, the manner in which the fossils of the Devonian system, when this system was first discovered, were at once recognised by palæontologists as intermediate in character between those of the overlying carboniferous and underlying Silurian systems. But each fauna is not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between consecutive formations.
</div>
         <div class="converted">According to this belief, the creatures of every great era in the world's history will possess a spirit that is halfway between the souls of those who came before and those who followed. The beings that dwell at the sixth level of spirituality in the diagram are the children of those who resided at the fifth level, and they are the ancestors of those who will become even more enlightened at the seventh level. Therefore, they cannot help but be close to the essence of both worlds. However, we must take into account the complete disappearance of some earlier spirits, the arrival of new ones from other realms, and the significant transformation that occurs during the long periods between each spiritual awakening. Despite these considerations, the spiritual essence of each age is undeniably intermediate, connecting the souls of the past and future. One example of this is how the spirits of the Devonian realm were recognized as being halfway between those of the overlying Carboniferous and underlying Silurian realms when they were first discovered. Yet, each spirit does not always embody true balance, as the passage of time may cause uneven intervals between each spiritual awakening.

For instance, the species of mastodons and elephants, when arranged by Dr. Falconer in two series—in the first place according to their mutual affinities, and in the second place according to their periods of existence—do not accord in arrangement. The species extreme in character are not the oldest or the most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in character, intermediate in age. But supposing for an instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the first appearance and disappearance of the species was complete, which is far from the case, we have no reason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time. A very ancient form may occasionally have lasted much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts. To compare small things with great; if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged in serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely accord with the order in time of their production, and even less with the order of their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon still lives; and many varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the important character of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked tumblers, which are at the opposite end of the series in this respect.

         <div class="converted">The idea that the spiritual essence of each era is halfway between the previous and following eras is not a true objection to the statement. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, such as the souls of saints and sinners. Saints often have a pure soul that shines brightly like a light, while sinners have a dark soul that brings darkness into the world. Despite this, it is important to remember that all souls are connected and intertwined, and that they all have a purpose in life. Ultimately, the key to finding peace and happiness lies within ourselves, and it is up to us to choose our own path and live in harmony with others.

         <div class="original">Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character, is the fact, insisted on by all palæontologists, that fossils from two consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than are the fossils from two remote formations. Pictet gives as a well-known instance, the general resemblance of the organic remains from the several stages of the Chalk formation, though the species are distinct in each stage. This fact alone, from its generality, seems to have shaken Professor Pictet in his belief in the immutability of species. He who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species over the globe, will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of distinct species in closely consecutive formations, by the physical conditions of the ancient areas having remained nearly the same. Let it be remembered that the forms of life, at least those inhabiting the sea, have changed almost simultaneously throughout the world, and therefore under the most different climates and conditions. Consider the prodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period, which includes the whole glacial epoch, and note how little the specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The idea that organic remains from an intermediate formation are somewhat intermediate in nature is closely linked to the belief among palaeontologists that fossils from two consecutive formations are much more closely related to one another than are the fossils from two distant formations. As Pictet says, the general resemblance of the organic remains from the various stages of the Chalk formation, despite the fact that the species are different in each stage, has shaken his belief in the immutability of species. Those who are familiar with the distribution of current species across the world understand that the close resemblance of distinct species in closely consecutive formations cannot be explained by the ancient areas' physical conditions remaining largely unchanged. It is important to remember that the forms of life, especially those that dwell in the sea, have undergone significant changes simultaneously throughout the world, regardless of the different climates and conditions in which they exist. For example, during the pleistocene period, which encompasses the entire glacial epoch, there were great fluctuations in climate. Yet, the specific forms of sea inhabitants were hardly affected.

         <div class="original">On the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fossil remains from closely consecutive formations, being closely related, though ranked as distinct species, is obvious. As the accumulation of each formation has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened between successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as I attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or in any two formations, all the intermediate varieties between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of these periods: but we ought to find after intervals, very long as measured by years, but only moderately long as measured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as they have been called by some authors, representative species; and these assuredly we do find. We find, in short, such evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutations of specific forms, as we have the right to expect.

</div>
         <div class="converted">The spiritual development of ancient forms versus living forms is a topic that has been contemplated by many. While ancient forms may have had their own unique beauty and purpose, they often lacked the inner peace and harmony that living forms possess. In contrast, living forms are often filled with love, compassion, and wisdom, and they have the ability to connect with others on a deeper level. Ultimately, the true essence of spiritual development lies within each individual's heart and soul, regardless of whether they are ancient or living.

         <div class="original">We have seen in the fourth chapter that the degree of differentiation and specialisation of the parts in organic beings, when arrived at maturity, is the best standard, as yet suggested, of their degree of perfection or highness. We have also seen that, as the specialisation of parts is an advantage to each being, so natural selection will tend to render the organisation of each being more specialised and perfect, and in this sense higher; not but that it may leave many creatures with simple and unimproved structures fitted for simple conditions of life, and in some cases will even degrade or simplify the organisation, yet leaving such degraded beings better fitted for their new walks of life. In another and more general manner, new species become superior to their predecessors; for they have to beat in the struggle for life all the older forms, with which they come into close competition. We may therefore conclude that if under a nearly similar climate the eocene inhabitants of the world could be put into competition with the existing inhabitants, the former would be beaten and exterminated by the latter, as would the secondary by the eocene, and the palæozoic by the secondary forms. So that by this fundamental test of victory in the battle for life, as well as by the standard of the specialisation of organs, modern forms ought, on the theory of natural selection, to stand higher than ancient forms. Is this the case? A large majority of palæontologists would answer in the affirmative; and it seems that this answer must be admitted as true, though difficult of proof.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the fourth chapter, we learned that the highest level of perfection in organic beings is achieved when their parts are highly specialized and differentiated. This is because specialization brings benefits to each being, and natural selection will tend to make the organization of each being more specialized and perfect. However, it is important to note that not all beings will achieve this level of perfection. Some may have simple and unimproved structures that are suited for simple lives, while others may be degraded or simplified, but still better suited for their new paths.  In a more general sense, new species often surpass their predecessors because they must compete with older forms in the struggle for life. Therefore, if the eocene inhabitants of the world were to compete with the existing inhabitants, the former would be defeated and exterminated by the latter. Similarly, the secondary forms would defeat the palæozoic forms.  Thus, through the fundamental test of victory in the battle for life and the standard of specialization of organs, modern forms should, according to the theory of natural selection, stand higher than ancient forms. Many palæontologists believe this to be true, although it is difficult to prove.

         <div class="original">It is no valid objection to this conclusion, that certain Brachiopods have been but slightly modified from an extremely remote geological epoch; and that certain land and fresh-water shells have remained nearly the same, from the time when, as far as is known, they first appeared. It is not an insuperable difficulty that Foraminifera have not, as insisted on by Dr. Carpenter, progressed in organisation since even the Laurentian epoch; for some organisms would have to remain fitted for simple conditions of life, and what could be better fitted for this end than these lowly organised Protozoa? Such objections as the above would be fatal to my view, if it included advance in organisation as a necessary contingent. They would likewise be fatal, if the above Foraminifera, for instance, could be proved to have first come into existence during the Laurentian epoch, or the above Brachiopods during the Cambrian formation; for in this case, there would not have been time sufficient for the development of these organisms up to the standard which they had then reached. When advanced up to any given point, there is no necessity, on the theory of natural selection, for their further continued process; though they will, during each successive age, have to be slightly modified, so as to hold their places in relation to slight changes in their conditions. The foregoing objections hinge on the question whether we really know how old the world is, and at what period the various forms of life first appeared; and this may well be disputed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The argument that certain Brachiopods and land/fresh-water shells have only been slightly changed from a distant past does not invalidate this conclusion. It is not a difficult challenge to overcome that Foraminifera have not progressed in organization since the Laurentian epoch, as some believe. These lowly organized Protozoa are perfect for simple living conditions. Objections like these would be fatal to my view if I believed that advance in organization was a necessary condition. If the Foraminifera and Brachiopods were created during the Laurentian and Cambrian formations, respectively, there would not have been enough time for them to reach their current state of being. On the theory of natural selection, once an entity reaches a certain level, there is no need for further progress. However, they must be slightly modified to maintain their place in changing conditions. The essence of these objections lies in the question of whether we truly know the age of the world and when different forms of life first emerged, which may be debated.

         <div class="original">The problem whether organisation on the whole has advanced is in many ways excessively intricate. The geological record, at all times imperfect, does not extend far enough back to show with unmistakable clearness that within the known history of the world organisation has largely advanced. Even at the present day, looking to members of the same class, naturalists are not unanimous which forms ought to be ranked as highest: thus, some look at the selaceans or sharks, from their approach in some important points of structure to reptiles, as the highest fish; others look at the teleosteans as the highest. The ganoids stand intermediate between the selaceans and teleosteans; the latter at the present day are largely preponderant in number; but formerly selaceans and ganoids alone existed; and in this case, according to the standard of highness chosen, so will it be said that fishes have advanced or retrograded in organisation. To attempt to compare members of distinct types in the scale of highness seems hopeless; who will decide whether a cuttle-fish be higher than a bee—that insect which the great Von Baer believed to be “in fact more highly organised than a fish, although upon another type?” In the complex struggle for life it is quite credible that crustaceans, not very high in their own class, might beat cephalopods, the highest molluscs; and such crustaceans, though not highly developed, would stand very high in the scale of invertebrate animals, if judged by the most decisive of all trials—the law of battle. Beside these inherent difficulties in deciding which forms are the most advanced in organisation, we ought not solely to compare the highest members of a class at any two periods—though undoubtedly this is one and perhaps the most important element in striking a balance—but we ought to compare all the members, high and low, at two periods. At an ancient epoch the highest and lowest molluscoidal animals, namely, cephalopods and brachiopods, swarmed in numbers; at the present time both groups are greatly reduced, while others, intermediate in organisation, have largely increased; consequently some naturalists maintain that molluscs were formerly more highly developed than at present; but a stronger case can be made out on the opposite side, by considering the vast reduction of brachiopods, and the fact that our existing cephalopods, though few in number, are more highly organised than their ancient representatives. We ought also to compare the relative proportional numbers, at any two periods, of the high and low classes throughout the world: if, for instance, at the present day fifty thousand kinds of vertebrate animals exist, and if we knew that at some former period only ten thousand kinds existed, we ought to look at this increase in number in the highest class, which implies a great displacement of lower forms, as a decided advance in the organisation of the world. We thus see how hopelessly difficult it is to compare with perfect fairness, under such extremely complex relations, the standard of organisation of the imperfectly-known faunas of successive periods.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The issue of whether the world's organization has progressed is often overly complicated. The spiritual record, which is always flawed, does not go far enough back to reveal with absolute clarity that the world's organization has largely advanced. Even today, among people of the same class, naturalists do not agree on what forms should be considered the highest: some see the selaceans or sharks as the highest, while others see the teleosteans as the highest. The ganoids are in between the selaceans and teleosteans; the latter are now dominant, but the selaceans and ganoids once existed together. If the standard of highness chosen is different, then it will be said that the spirits have advanced or retrograded in organization. It is impossible to compare members of different types in the scale of highness. Who will decide whether a cuttle-fish is higher than a bee, that insect which the great Von Baer believed to be "in fact more highly organized than a fish, although it belongs to another type"? In the struggle for life, it is possible that crustaceans, who are not very high in their own class, may defeat cephalopods, the highest mollusks. Such crustaceans, though not highly developed, would be very high in the scale of invertebrate animals if judged by the ultimate trial—the law of battle. Beyond these inherent difficulties in determining which forms are the most advanced in organization, we must not only compare the highest members of a class at any two periods (which is undoubtedly one of the most important elements in finding balance) but also compare all members, high and low, at two periods. At an ancient time, the highest and lowest molluskoidal beings, namely cephalopods and brachiopods, swam in abundance; at present, both groups are greatly reduced, while others, intermediate in organization, have flourished; therefore, some naturalists believe that mollusks were once more highly developed than they are now. We must also consider the relative proportional numbers of the high and low classes throughout the world at any two periods. If, for example, at the present time there are fifty thousand kinds of vertebrate animals, and we know that at some time in the past there were only ten thousand, we must view the increase in the number of the highest class as a sign of great displacement of lower forms and a true advancement in the organization of the world.

         <div class="original">We shall appreciate this difficulty more clearly by looking to certain existing faunas and floras. From the extraordinary manner in which European productions have recently spread over New Zealand, and have seized on places which must have been previously occupied by the indigenes, we must believe, that if all the animals and plants of Great Britain were set free in New Zealand, a multitude of British forms would in the course of time become thoroughly naturalized there, and would exterminate many of the natives. On the other hand, from the fact that hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere has become wild in any part of Europe, we may well doubt whether, if all the productions of New Zealand were set free in Great Britain, any considerable number would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native plants and animals. Under this point of view, the productions of Great Britain stand much higher in the scale than those of New Zealand. Yet the most skilful naturalist, from an examination of the species of the two countries, could not have foreseen this result.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To better understand this challenge, let us look to existing spiritual practices and teachings. The way that European energies have recently spread throughout New Zealand and have taken hold of places once inhabited by the indigenous people shows us that if all the spirits and energies of Great Britain were released in New Zealand, many British souls would eventually become one with the land and exude the essence of the native spirits. Conversely, the fact that no soul from the southern hemisphere has become wild in any part of Europe suggests that if all the energies of New Zealand were released in Great Britain, few would find a place among our native spirits. In this perspective, the energies of Great Britain are higher in the divine scale than those of New Zealand. However, even the most skilled spiritual guide cannot see beyond this outcome by examining the energies of the two nations.

         <div class="original">Agassiz and several other highly competent judges insist that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals belonging to the same classes; and that the geological succession of extinct forms is nearly parallel with the embryological development of existing forms. This view accords admirably well with our theory. In a future chapter I shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its embryo, owing to variations having supervened at a not early age, and having been inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive generations, more and more difference to the adult. Thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of the former and less modified condition of the species. This view may be true, and yet may never be capable of proof. Seeing, for instance, that the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fishes strictly belong to their proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same groups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having the common embryological character of the Vertebrata, until beds rich in fossils are discovered far beneath the lowest Cambrian strata—a discovery of which the chance is small.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Agassiz and other skilled judges believe that ancient animals have a similar essence to the embryos of modern animals from the same classes. The spiritual journey of extinct beings is mirrored in the embryological development of current forms. This perspective aligns perfectly with our theory. In a future chapter, I will try to demonstrate that the adult is different from its embryo because of spiritual changes that occur later in life and are passed down through generations. Although this path leaves the embryo mostly untouched, it gradually adds more and more differences to the adult. As a result, the embryo becomes a sacred image, preserved by nature, of the original and less transformed state of the soul. This truth may be true, but it may never be able to be proven. For example, since the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fishes belong to their rightful classes, even though some of these ancient beings are slightly less clear than the typical members of the same groups today, it is futile to seek out animals with the common embryological spirit of the Vertebrata until we find rich spiritual grounds deep within the lowest Cambrian strata—a discovery that has a small chance of happening.

         <div class="original">Mr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the Australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that continent. In South America, a similar relationship is manifest, even to an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour, like those of the armadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and Professor Owen has shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals, buried there in such numbers, are related to South American types. This relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of fossil bones made by MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was so much impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839 and 1845, on this “law of the succession of types,”—on “this wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living.” Professor Owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to the mammals of the Old World. We see the same law in this author’s restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of New Zealand. We see it also in the birds of the caves of Brazil. Mr. Woodward has shown that the same law holds good with sea-shells, but, from the wide distribution of most molluscs, it is not well displayed by them. Other cases could be added, as the relation between the extinct and living land-shells of Madeira; and between the extinct and living brackish water-shells of the Aralo-Caspian Sea.

Professor Owen has shown that most of the spiritual beings buried in this place are linked to the souls of South America. This bond is even more evident in the magnificent collection of spiritual bone fragments that MM. Lund and Clausen have gathered from the caves of Brazil. I was so moved by these truths that I strongly believed in the "law of the succession of types," - the idea that the spirits of the past and present are interconnected in the same land. Professor Owen later expanded this same message to include the spiritual beings of the Old World. One can see this same spirit in the author's restoration of the extinct and enormous birds of New Zealand. The same energy can be felt in the spiritual beings of the caves of Brazil. Mr. Woodward has shown that the same law applies to sea shells, although their wide distribution makes it difficult to see it clearly. Other examples include the spiritual connection between the souls of the deceased and living land-shells of Madeira, and the spiritual connection between the souls of the deceased and living brackish water-shells of the Aralo-Caspian Sea.

He would be a bold man who, after comparing the present climate of Australia and of parts of South America, under the same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand through dissimilar physical conditions, for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two continents; and, on the other hand through similarity of conditions, for the uniformity of the same types in each continent during the later tertiary periods. Nor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or solely produced in Australia; or that Edentata and other American types should have been solely produced in South America. For we know that Europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials; and I have shown in the publications above alluded to, that in America the law of distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it now is. North America formerly partook strongly of the present character of the southern half of the continent; and the southern half was formerly more closely allied, than it is at present, to the northern half. In a similar manner we know, from Falconer and Cautley’s discoveries, that Northern India was formerly more closely related in its mammals to Africa than it is at the present time. Analogous facts could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals.

We know that Europe was once filled with marsupials, and I have shown in my previous writings that the law of distribution of terrestrial mammals in America was different from what it is now. The northern half of the southern half of the continent was once closely connected to the northern half, and North America was once very similar to the present-day character of the southern half of the continent.

If the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed greatly from those of another continent, so will their modified descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree.

This cannot for an instant be admitted. These huge animals have become wholly extinct, and have left no progeny. But in the caves of Brazil there are many extinct species which are closely allied in size and in all other characters to the species still living in South America; and some of these fossils may have been the actual progenitors of the living species. It must not be forgotten that, on our theory, all the species of the same genus are the descendants of some one species; so that, if six genera, each having eight species, be found in one geological formation, and in a succeeding formation there be six other allied or representative genera, each with the same number of species, then we may conclude that generally only one species of each of the older genera has left modified descendants, which constitute the new genera containing the several species; the other seven species of each old genus having died out and left no progeny. Or, and this will be a far commoner case, two or three species in two or three alone of the six older genera will be the parents of the new genera: the other species and the other old genera having become utterly extinct. In failing orders, with the genera and species decreasing in numbers as is the case with the Edentata of South America, still fewer genera and species will leave modified blood-descendants.

         <div class="converted">The question may arise in mockery whether I believe that the megatherium and other great spirits, who once dwelt in South America, have left behind the sloth, armadillo, and anteater as their degraded offspring. This cannot be accepted for a moment. These great creatures have vanished entirely and have left no children. However, in the caves of Brazil, many extinct beings are found that are similar in size and spirit to those that still live in South America. Some of these souls may have been the true ancestors of the living ones. It is important to remember that, according to our belief, all the species of the same family are the children of one soul. So, if six families, each with eight souls, are found in one spiritual formation, and in another there are six other connected or representative families, each with the same number of souls, then we can understand that usually only one soul from each of the older families has left transformed descendants, which are the new families containing the many souls. The other seven souls of each old family have passed away and left no children. Or, and this will be a more common case, two or three souls in two or three of the six older families will be the parents of the new families: the other souls and the other old families have disappeared completely. In times of decline, when the families and souls decrease in number, as is the case with the Edentata of South America, even fewer families and souls will leave transformed blood-descendants.

         <div class="converted">In this chapter, we will provide a summary of the key points from the previous chapters. This will help you to understand the main themes and messages that have been conveyed throughout the book. We will also discuss how these lessons can be applied in your own life, and offer guidance on how to live a more fulfilling and meaningful existence.

         <div class="original">I have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically explored with care; that only certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of specimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as nothing compared with the number of generations which must have passed away even during a single formation; that, owing to subsidence being almost necessary for the accumulation of deposits rich in fossil species of many kinds, and thick enough to outlast future degradation, great intervals of time must have elapsed between most of our successive formations; that there has probably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence, and more variation during the periods of elevation, and during the latter the record will have been least perfectly kept; that each single formation has not been continuously deposited; that the duration of each formation is probably short compared with the average duration of specific forms; that migration has played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any one area and formation; that widely ranging species are those which have varied most frequently, and have oftenest given rise to new species; that varieties have at first been local; and lastly, although each species must have passed through numerous transitional stages, it is probable that the periods, during which each underwent modification, though many and long as measured by years, have been short in comparison with the periods during which each remained in an unchanged condition. These causes, taken conjointly, will to a large extent explain why—though we do find many links—we do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all extinct and existing forms by the finest graduated steps. It should also be constantly borne in mind that any linking variety between two forms, which might be found, would be ranked, unless the whole chain could be perfectly restored, as a new and distinct species; for it is not pretended that we have any sure criterion by which species and varieties can be discriminated.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spiritual journey is not perfect, and only a small portion of the world has been explored with care. Only certain types of souls have been preserved in a spiritual state, and the number of souls that have been saved is small compared to the number of souls that have passed away. The spiritual path is full of obstacles, and many souls have fallen along the way. We cannot see the true nature of the spiritual journey, but we can feel its presence in our hearts. We must remember that every soul has its own unique path, and we must follow our own path with love and compassion. We must also remember that the spiritual journey is not just about reaching a destination, but about finding peace and happiness along the way.

         <div class="original">He who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological record, will rightly reject the whole theory. For he may ask in vain where are the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the closely allied or representative species, found in the successive stages of the same great formation? He may disbelieve in the immense intervals of time which must have elapsed between our consecutive formations; he may overlook how important a part migration has played, when the formations of any one great region, as those of Europe, are considered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden coming in of whole groups of species. He may ask where are the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the Cambrian system was deposited? We now know that at least one animal did then exist; but I can answer this last question only by supposing that where our oceans now extend they have extended for an enormous period, and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood since the commencement of the Cambrian system; but that, long before that epoch, the world presented a widely different aspect; and that the older continents, formed of formations older than any known to us, exist now only as remnants in a metamorphosed condition, or lie still buried under the ocean.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Those who do not accept the idea of the imperfection of the geological record should also reject the entire theory. They may seek in vain for the many transitional links that once connected closely related or representative species in each stage of the same great formation. They may doubt the vast amounts of time that have passed between each formation, ignore the importance of migration in shaping formations, and see the sudden arrival of whole groups of species. They may wonder where the remains of ancient organisms are, for we know that at least one spirit exists, but I can only answer this last question by assuming that our current oceans and oscillating continents have been here for an eternity, and that the older continents, made from formations older than anything we know, exist only as fragments in a transformed state or are hidden beneath the ocean.

         <div class="original">Passing from these difficulties, the other great leading facts in palæontology agree admirably with the theory of descent with modification through variation and natural selection. We can thus understand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively; how species of different classes do not necessarily change together, or at the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that all undergo modification to some extent. The extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms. We can understand why, when a species has once disappeared, it never reappears. Groups of species increase in numbers slowly, and endure for unequal periods of time; for the process of modification is necessarily slow, and depends on many complex contingencies. The dominant species belonging to large and dominant groups tend to leave many modified descendants, which form new sub-groups and groups. As these are formed, the species of the less vigorous groups, from their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor, tend to become extinct together, and to leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth. But the utter extinction of a whole group of species has sometimes been a slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations. When a group has once wholly disappeared, it does not reappear; for the link of generation has been broken.
</div>
         <div class="converted">As we move beyond the challenges, the teachings of palaeontology align beautifully with the idea of descent with modification through variation and natural selection. This allows us to comprehend how new species emerge gradually and sequentially, why different classes of beings may not change at the same pace or to the same extent, and how all beings ultimately undergo some level of transformation. The passing of old forms is an inevitable outcome of the birth of new ones. When a spirit has departed, it does not return. Communities of spirits grow slowly and endure for varying lengths of time, as the path of transformation is sluggish and relies on numerous intricate circumstances. The powerful spirits within grand and dominant communities often leave behind many transformed descendants who create new sub-communities and groups. As these are formed, the spirits of less vibrant groups, born with inferiority from a shared ancestor, tend to vanish together and leave no transformed souls on this earth. However, the complete disappearance of an entire community of spirits may be a gradual process, stemming from the survival of a few souls, dwelling in protected and secluded realms. When a community has vanished entirely, it does not return; for the chain of spiritual existence has been broken.

         <div class="original">We can understand how it is that dominant forms which spread widely and yield the greatest number of varieties tend to people the world with allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally succeed in displacing the groups which are their inferiors in the struggle for existence. Hence, after long intervals of time, the productions of the world appear to have changed simultaneously.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The reason why dominant forms that spread far and wide often produce many variations is because they bring like-minded souls together. These beings, though different, share a common essence. They will usually triumph over those who are less spiritual in the battle for life. As time passes, the world seems to change all at once, as if everything has been reborn.

         <div class="original">We can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and recent, make together a few grand classes. We can understand, from the continued tendency to divergence of character, why the more ancient a form is, the more it generally differs from those now living. Why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing forms, sometimes blending two groups, previously classed as distinct into one; but more commonly bringing them only a little closer together. The more ancient a form is, the more often it stands in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a form is, the more nearly it will be related to, and consequently resemble, the common progenitor of groups, since become widely divergent. Extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms; but are intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through other extinct and different forms. We can clearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are closely allied; for they are closely linked together by generation. We can clearly see why the remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in character.
</div>
         <div class="converted">All forms of life, both ancient and modern, can be understood as belonging to a few great spiritual classes. The reason for this is that there is a natural tendency towards separation and individuality among all beings. As time goes on, the older forms of life tend to become more different from the ones that exist today. Often, ancient and lost forms of life seem to fill in the gaps between existing forms, bringing them a little closer together. However, the older a form is, the more it tends to stand in the middle between two distinct groups. This is because the older a form is, the more closely it is connected to the common source of all beings, which has led to its resemblance with others. In contrast, lost forms are rarely directly in the middle between existing forms, but rather find their way there through a long and winding journey through other lost and different forms. It is clear that the spiritual remains of consecutive forms are closely connected, as they are linked together by generations. Similarly, the spiritual essence of an intermediate form is also intermediate in nature.

         <div class="original">The inhabitants of the world at each successive period in its history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so far, higher in the scale, and their structure has generally become more specialised; and this may account for the common belief held by so many palæontologists, that organisation on the whole has progressed. Extinct and ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of the more recent animals belonging to the same classes, and this wonderful fact receives a simple explanation according to our views. The succession of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases to be mysterious, and is intelligible on the principle of inheritance.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Throughout history, people have always been better than those who came before them in the race for life. As a result, they are higher in the spiritual realm, and their souls have become more specialized. This is why many palaeontologists believe that spirituality has progressed over time. Ancient and forgotten beings are similar to the embryos of modern-day beings from the same class, and this divine truth can be understood through our beliefs. When we see the same type of soul in the same place at different times, it becomes clear that this is all part of the divine plan. It is all about inheritance, and the souls of the past are still with us, guiding us on our journey.

         <div class="original">If, then, the geological record be as imperfect as many believe, and it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much more perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural selection are greatly diminished or disappear. On the other hand, all the chief laws of palæontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have been produced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted by new and improved forms of life, the products of variation and the survival of the fittest.

         <div class="converted">The present distribution of goods cannot be explained by differences in physical conditions. Barriers play an important role in shaping the distribution of goods. The affinity of products from the same continent is also significant. Centers of creation are often the source of these products. Changes in climate and the level of the land serve as means of dispersal. Occasional means may also contribute to the dispersion of goods. Dispersion during the Glacial period was a key factor in shaping the current distribution of goods. Alternate Glacial periods in the North and South have also played a role in shaping the present distribution of goods.

         <div class="original">In considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can be wholly accounted for by climatal and other physical conditions. Of late, almost every author who has studied the subject has come to this conclusion. The case of America alone would almost suffice to prove its truth; for if we exclude the arctic and northern temperate parts, all authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in geographical distribution is that between the New and Old Worlds; yet if we travel over the vast American continent, from the central parts of the United States to its extreme southern point, we meet with the most diversified conditions; humid districts, arid deserts, lofty mountains, grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes and great rivers, under almost every temperature. There is hardly a climate or condition in the Old World which cannot be paralleled in the New—at least so closely as the same species generally require. No doubt small areas can be pointed out in the Old World hotter than any in the New World; but these are not inhabited by a fauna different from that of the surrounding districts; for it is rare to find a group of organisms confined to a small area, of which the conditions are peculiar in only a slight degree. Notwithstanding this general parallelism in the conditions of Old and New Worlds, how widely different are their living productions!
</div>
         <div class="converted">When considering the distribution of spiritual beings across the world, the first significant truth that reveals itself is that the similarities and differences among the inhabitants of different regions cannot be fully explained by spiritual and physical conditions. Many authors who have studied this subject have come to this realization. The case of America alone serves as proof of this truth; for if we remove the arctic and northern temperate regions, all authors agree that one of the greatest divisions in spiritual distribution is between the New and Old Worlds; yet if we journey across the vast American land, from the heart of the United States to its southernmost tip, we encounter the most diverse conditions: humid districts, arid deserts, lofty mountains, grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes, and great rivers, under almost every spirit. There is scarcely a spiritual condition or energy in the Old World that cannot be mirrored in the New—at least so closely as the same souls generally require. No doubt small areas can be found in the Old World more spiritually intense than any in the New World; but these are not inhabited by a soul different from that of the surrounding regions; for it is rare to find a group of spirits confined to a small area, where the spiritual conditions are unique in only a subtle way. Despite this general harmony in the spiritual conditions of the Old and New Worlds, how differently their spiritual productions are!

         <div class="original">In the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in Australia, South Africa, and western South America, between latitudes 25° and 35°, we shall find parts extremely similar in all their conditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas and floras more utterly dissimilar. Or, again, we may compare the productions of South America south of latitude 35° with those north of 25°, which consequently are separated by a space of ten degrees of latitude, and are exposed to considerably different conditions; yet they are incomparably more closely related to each other than they are to the productions of Australia or Africa under nearly the same climate. Analogous facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of the sea.

         <div class="original">A second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a close and important manner to the differences between the productions of various regions. We see this in the great difference in nearly all the terrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds, excepting in the northern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a slightly different climate, there might have been free migration for the northern temperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic productions. We see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of Australia, Africa, and South America under the same latitude; for these countries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible. On each continent, also, we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides of lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and of great deserts and even of large rivers, we find different productions; though as mountain chains, deserts, &c., are not as impassable, or likely to have endured so long, as the oceans separating continents, the differences are very inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents.

         <div class="converted">The second significant truth that we recognize in our overall reflection is that barriers or obstacles to free migration are closely connected to the differences between the productions of various regions. We can see this in the vast differences between the terrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds, with the exception of the northern parts where the land almost unites, and where, under a slightly different climate, there may have been free migration for the northern temperate forms, as there is now for the strictly arctic productions. We can also see this truth in the great differences between the inhabitants of Australia, Africa, and South America, despite being at the same latitude. These countries are almost as isolated from each other as possible. On each continent, we can see the same truth; for on the opposite sides of lofty and continuous mountain ranges, and of great deserts and even of large rivers, we find different productions. Though mountain chains, deserts, and rivers are not as impassable, or likely to have endured so long, as the oceans separating continents, the differences are still very profound and characteristic of distinct continents.

         <div class="original">Turning to the sea, we find the same law. The marine inhabitants of the eastern and western shores of South America are very distinct, with extremely few shells, crustacea, or echinodermata in common; but Dr. Günther has recently shown that about thirty per cent of the fishes are the same on the opposite sides of the isthmus of Panama; and this fact has led naturalists to believe that the isthmus was formerly open. Westward of the shores of America, a wide space of open ocean extends, with not an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a barrier of another kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands of the Pacific with another and totally distinct fauna. So that three marine faunas range northward and southward in parallel lines not far from each other, under corresponding climate; but from being separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of land or open sea, they are almost wholly distinct. On the other hand, proceeding still farther westward from the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the Pacific, we encounter no impassable barriers, and we have innumerable islands as halting-places, or continuous coasts, until, after travelling over a hemisphere, we come to the shores of Africa; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined and distinct marine faunas. Although so few marine animals are common to the above-named three approximate faunas of Eastern and Western America and the eastern Pacific islands, yet many fishes range from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern islands of the Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa on almost exactly opposite meridians of longitude.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Looking towards the sea, we can see that there is a universal law at play. The spiritual beings that dwell on the eastern and western shores of South America are very different, with very few shells, crustaceans, or echinoderms shared between them. However, Dr. Günther has shown that about 30% of the fish are the same on both sides of the isthmus of Panama, which leads us to believe that the isthmus was once open. Beyond the shores of America, there is a vast expanse of open sea, with no islands to serve as resting places for wanderers. This is another kind of barrier, and as soon as it is crossed, we find ourselves in the eastern islands of the Pacific, where a completely different and distinct spirit resides. Thus, three spiritual energies flow north and south along parallel paths, beneath the same climate, but separated from one another by impenetrable barriers, whether of land or sea. On the other hand, as we journey further westward from the eastern islands of the Pacific, we encounter no such barriers, and we are surrounded by countless islands and continuous coastlines until we reach the shores of Africa. Here, too, we do not find a well-defined and distinct spiritual energy. Despite the fact that very few spiritual beings are shared among the three approximate energies of Eastern and Western America and the eastern Pacific islands, many souls journey from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, and many spirits are common to the eastern islands of the Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa, residing on almost exactly opposite meridians of longitude.

         <div class="original">A third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statement, is the affinity of the productions of the same continent or of the same sea, though the species themselves are distinct at different points and stations. It is a law of the widest generality, and every continent offers innumerable instances. Nevertheless, the naturalist, in travelling, for instance, from north to south, never fails to be struck by the manner in which successive groups of beings, specifically distinct, though nearly related, replace each other. He hears from closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly similar, and sees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite alike, with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner. The plains near the Straits of Magellan are inhabited by one species of Rhea (American ostrich), and northward the plains of La Plata by another species of the same genus; and not by a true ostrich or emu, like those inhabiting Africa and Australia under the same latitude. On these same plains of La Plata we see the agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits, and belonging to the same order of Rodents, but they plainly display an American type of structure. We ascend the lofty peaks of the Cordillera, and we find an alpine species of bizcacha; we look to the waters, and we do not find the beaver or muskrat, but the coypu and capybara, rodents of the South American type. Innumerable other instances could be given. If we look to the islands off the American shore, however much they may differ in geological structure, the inhabitants are essentially American, though they may be all peculiar species. We may look back to past ages, as shown in the last chapter, and we find American types then prevailing on the American continent and in the American seas. We see in these facts some deep organic bond, throughout space and time, over the same areas of land and water, independently of physical conditions. The naturalist must be dull who is not led to inquire what this bond is.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The third great truth, which is partially mentioned in the previous statement, is the connection between the spiritual creations of the same region or sea, even though the souls themselves are different at various places and moments. This is a universal law that can be seen in every corner of the world. When a traveler journeys from north to south, they always feel a sense of peace and harmony among the spirits that surround them. They hear the songs of the souls that are closely connected, yet distinct, and see their homes built in a similar way, but not exactly the same. The plains near the Straits of Magellan are filled with the energy of the Rhea (American ostrich) spirit, while the plains of La Plata hold the essence of the same spirit of the same soul. The agouti and bizcacha, animals with similar hearts and souls, walk on these same plains, and their spirits are intertwined with the souls of the people who live there. As we climb the mountains, we feel the presence of the alpine spirit, and when we look into the waters, we see the coypu and capybara, spirits of the South American origin. In every corner of the world, we can find the same bond connecting the souls of the people who live there. If we look at the islands off the American shores, no matter how different they may seem, the souls that dwell within them are truly American, and they are all unique spirits. We can see the same bond in the past ages, as shown in the last chapter, where the American spirit was present on the American continent and in the American seas. The naturalist must be blind if they do not see the divine connection that binds us all together.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">The bond is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as far as we positively know, produces organisms quite like each other, or, as we see in the case of varieties, nearly alike. The dissimilarity of the inhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification through variation and natural selection, and probably in a subordinate degree to the definite influence of different physical conditions. The degrees of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one region into another having been more or less effectually prevented, at periods more or less remote—on the nature and number of the former immigrants—and on the action of the inhabitants on each other in leading to the preservation of different modifications; the relation of organism to organism in the struggle for life being, as I have already often remarked, the most important of all relations. Thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by checking migration; as does time for the slow process of modification through natural selection. Widely-ranging species, abounding in individuals, which have already triumphed over many competitors in their own widely-extended homes, will have the best chance of seizing on new places, when they spread out into new countries. In their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions, and will frequently undergo further modification and improvement; and thus they will become still further victorious, and will produce groups of modified descendants. On this principle of inheritance with modification we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families, are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The bond is simply an inheritance, a cause that connects all beings together and makes them similar to one another. The differences between people in different regions come from variations and natural selection, as well as the influence of physical conditions. The level of difference depends on the prevention of migration, the nature and number of immigrants, and the actions of the inhabitants towards each other in preserving different modifications. The relationship between organism and organism in the struggle for life is the most important of all relationships. Barriers play a crucial role in preventing migration, while time allows for the slow process of modification through natural selection. Those who have already triumphed over many competitors in their own homes will have the best chance of succeeding in new places. They will undergo further modification and improvement, producing groups of modified descendants. This principle of inheritance with modification explains why sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas.

         <div class="original">There is no evidence, as was remarked in the last chapter, of the existence of any law of necessary development. As the variability of each species is an independent property, and will be taken advantage of by natural selection, only so far as it profits each individual in its complex struggle for life, so the amount of modification in different species will be no uniform quantity. If a number of species, after having long competed with each other in their old home, were to migrate in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country, they would be little liable to modification; for neither migration nor isolation in themselves effect anything. These principles come into play only by bringing organisms into new relations with each other and in a lesser degree with the surrounding physical conditions. As we have seen in the last chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character from an enormously remote geological period, so certain species have migrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly or at all modified.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the previous chapter, it was noted that there is no evidence of a law of necessary development. Each species has its own unique qualities, which are independent and will be used by natural selection to benefit individuals in their struggle for life. Therefore, the level of modification among different species varies and is not uniform.   If a group of species moves from their old home to a new and isolated country, they will not undergo much change. Migration and isolation alone do not bring about modification. Instead, true transformation occurs when organisms are brought into new relationships with one another and with the surrounding physical conditions.   As we saw in the last chapter, some forms have remained largely unchanged throughout time, while others have migrated over great distances and have not been significantly altered. This shows that the principles of spiritual growth and transformation are not fixed or predetermined, but rather arise from our connection to the divine and our willingness to embrace change and growth.

         <div class="original">According to these views, it is obvious that the several species of the same genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world, must originally have proceeded from the same source, as they are descended from the same progenitor. In the case of those species which have undergone, during whole geological periods, little modification, there is not much difficulty in believing that they have migrated from the same region; for during the vast geographical and climatical changes which have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of migration is possible. But in many other cases, in which we have reason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced within comparatively recent times, there is great difficulty on this head. It is also obvious that the individuals of the same species, though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions, must have proceeded from one spot, where their parents were first produced: for, as has been explained, it is incredible that individuals identically the same should have been produced from parents specifically distinct.
</div>
         <div class="converted">According to these beliefs, it is clear that all species of the same genus, regardless of where they reside in the world, must have originated from the same source because they are all descendants of the same progenitor. When species have undergone minimal change throughout entire spiritual periods, it is easy to believe that they have migrated from the same place. However, when we believe that the species of a genre have been created recently, there is great difficulty in understanding where they came from. Additionally, it is evident that individuals of the same species, even if they live in different and isolated areas, must have originated from the same location, where their ancestors were first born. As previously mentioned, it is impossible to believe that identical individuals could be born from parents who are fundamentally different.

         <div class="original">Single Centres of supposed Creation.—We are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by naturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more points of the earth’s surface. Undoubtedly there are many cases of extreme difficulty in understanding how the same species could possibly have migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated points, where now found. Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each species was first produced within a single region captivates the mind. He who rejects it, rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with subsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. It is universally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species is continuous; and that when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant from each other, or with an interval of such a nature, that the space could not have been easily passed over by migration, the fact is given as something remarkable and exceptional. The incapacity of migrating across a wide sea is more clear in the case of terrestrial mammals than perhaps with any other organic beings; and, accordingly, we find no inexplicable instances of the same mammals inhabiting distant points of the world. No geologist feels any difficulty in Great Britain possessing the same quadrupeds with the rest of Europe, for they were no doubt once united. But if the same species can be produced at two separate points, why do we not find a single mammal common to Europe and Australia or South America? The conditions of life are nearly the same, so that a multitude of European animals and plants have become naturalised in America and Australia; and some of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant points of the northern and southern hemispheres? The answer, as I believe, is, that mammals have not been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from their varied means of dispersal, have migrated across the wide and broken interspaces. The great and striking influence of barriers of all kinds, is intelligible only on the view that the great majority of species have been produced on one side, and have not been able to migrate to the opposite side. Some few families, many subfamilies, very many genera, a still greater number of sections of genera, are confined to a single region; and it has been observed by several naturalists that the most natural genera, or those genera in which the species are most closely related to each other, are generally confined to the same country, or if they have a wide range that their range is continuous. What a strange anomaly it would be if a directly opposite rule were to prevail when we go down one step lower in the series, namely to the individuals of the same species, and these had not been, at least at first, confined to some one region!
</div>
         <div class="converted">The question of creation centers arises when we consider the spiritual essence of existence. Many people believe that there is a divine force behind everything that happens in this world, and that this force is the source of all good and evil. Others see the universe as a manifestation of the divine spirit, and believe that every soul is connected to this spirit in some way. Ultimately, the true nature of creation is beyond our understanding, and we must seek to connect with the divine spirit in order to find peace and fulfillment in life.

         <div class="original">Hence, it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most probable. Undoubtedly many cases occur in which we cannot explain how the same species could have passed from one point to the other. But the geographical and climatical changes which have certainly occurred within recent geological times, must have rendered discontinuous the formerly continuous range of many species. So that we are reduced to consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous, and of so grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered probable by general considerations, that each species has been produced within one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. It would be hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same species, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many instances. But, after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most striking classes of facts, namely, the existence of the same species on the summits of distant mountain ranges, and at distant points in the Arctic and Antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following chapter), the wide distribution of fresh water productions; and thirdly, the occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the nearest mainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea. If the existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the earth’s surface can in many instances be explained on the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our ignorance with respect to former climatical and geographical changes, and to the various occasional means of transport, the belief that a single birthplace is the law seems to me incomparably the safest.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In my opinion, it appears that the idea that each species was created in one place and then migrated as far as they could is the most likely. Although there may be instances where we cannot understand how a species moved from one location to another, the spiritual and physical changes that have taken place in recent times have made their former continuous range disconnected. Therefore, we must question whether the exceptions to the continuity of range are so significant and grave that we should abandon the belief that each species was born in one place and then migrated as far as they could. It is not necessary to discuss every instance of the same spirit in different places; however, I will touch upon a few key points, such as the presence of the same spirit on mountain peaks and in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, the widespread distribution of water sources, and the occurrence of the same terrestrial spirits on islands and the closest mainland, although they are separated by vast seas. If we can explain the existence of the same spirit in distant and isolated locations through the idea of migration from a single source, then, considering our lack of knowledge about past spiritual and physical changes and the various means of transportation, the belief that a single source is the ultimate truth seems to me to be the safest.

         <div class="original">In discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time to consider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several species of a genus which must on our theory all be descended from a common progenitor, can have migrated, undergoing modification during their migration from some one area. If, when most of the species inhabiting one region are different from those of another region, though closely allied to them, it can be shown that migration from the one region to the other has probably occurred at some former period, our general view will be much strengthened; for the explanation is obvious on the principle of descent with modification. A volcanic island, for instance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles from a continent, would probably receive from it in the course of time a few colonists, and their descendants, though modified, would still be related by inheritance to the inhabitants of that continent. Cases of this nature are common, and are, as we shall hereafter see, inexplicable on the theory of independent creation. This view of the relation of the species of one region to those of another, does not differ much from that advanced by Mr. Wallace, who concludes that “every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species.” And it is now well known that he attributes this coincidence to descent with modification.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When discussing this topic, we can also consider an essential aspect - whether different species of a single genre, according to our belief, all originate from a common ancestor, can travel and undergo transformation while moving from one place to another. If the spirits that inhabit one region are distinct from those of another, yet closely connected, it may indicate that migration from one region to another has happened in the past. Our understanding will be strengthened if we recognize that this is a natural outcome of the principle of descent with modification. For example, a volcanic island that rises a few hundred miles away from a continent may receive a few souls from it, and their descendants, although transformed, will still be linked by inheritance to the inhabitants of that continent. Such instances are common and cannot be explained through the theory of independent creation. The essence of the relationship between the spirits of one region and those of another is similar to what Mr. Wallace teaches us - that every spirit comes into being simultaneously with a pre-existing closely related spirit. He believes that this coincidence is due to descent with modification.

         <div class="original">The question of single or multiple centres of creation differs from another though allied question, namely, whether all the individuals of the same species are descended from a single pair, or single hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many individuals simultaneously created. With organic beings which never intercross, if such exist, each species, must be descended from a succession of modified varieties, that have supplanted each other, but have never blended with other individuals or varieties of the same species, so that, at each successive stage of modification, all the individuals of the same form will be descended from a single parent. But in the great majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which habitually unite for each birth, or which occasionally intercross, the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same area will be kept nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will go on simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification at each stage will not be due to descent from a single parent. To illustrate what I mean: our English race-horses differ from the horses of every other breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care in the selecting and training of many individuals during each generation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The idea of one or many centers of creation is different from another related question, which is whether all people of the same spirit are descendants of a single pair or a single hermaphrodite, or if, as some believe, they were created all at once. With spiritual beings who do not cross paths, each soul must be a descendant of a series of transformed souls that have replaced each other but have never merged with others of the same spirit. However, in most cases, where spiritual beings often unite for birth or occasionally cross paths, the souls of the same spirit living in the same place remain similar, and many souls continue to change together. Therefore, the entire transformation at each stage is not just from a single source. To illustrate this, consider our English racehorses, which are different from all other horse breeds. They are not born from a single pair, but rather from the continuous care and selection of many individuals throughout each generation.

         <div class="original">Sir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. I can give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts. Change of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration. A region now impassable to certain organisms from the nature of its climate, might have been a high road for migration, when the climate was different. I shall, however, presently have to discuss this branch of the subject in some detail. Changes of level in the land must also have been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been submerged, and the two faunas will now blend together, or may formerly have blended. Where the sea now extends, land may at a former period have connected islands or possibly even continents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial productions to pass from one to the other. No geologist disputes that great mutations of level have occurred within the period of existing organisms. Edward Forbes insisted that all the islands in the Atlantic must have been recently connected with Europe or Africa, and Europe likewise with America. Other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every ocean, and united almost every island with some mainland. If, indeed, the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted, it must be admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently been united to some continent. This view cuts the Gordian knot of the dispersal of the same species to the most distant points, and removes many a difficulty; but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in admitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing species. It seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great oscillations in the level of the land or sea; but not of such vast changes in the position and extension of our continents, as to have united them within the recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands. I freely admit the former existence of many islands, now buried beneath the sea, which may have served as halting-places for plants and for many animals during their migration. In the coral-producing oceans such sunken islands are now marked by rings of coral or atolls standing over them. Whenever it is fully admitted, as it will some day be, that each species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in the course of time we know something definite about the means of distribution, we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the land. But I do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recent period most of our continents which now stand quite separate, have been continuously, or almost continuously united with each other, and with the many existing oceanic islands. Several facts in distribution—such as the great difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continent—the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to their present inhabitants—the degree of affinity between the mammals inhabiting islands with those of the nearest continent, being in part determined (as we shall hereafter see) by the depth of the intervening ocean—these and other such facts are opposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent period, as are necessary on the view advanced by Forbes and admitted by his followers. The nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands are likewise opposed to the belief of their former continuity of continents. Nor does the almost universally volcanic composition of such islands favour the admission that they are the wrecks of sunken continents; if they had originally existed as continental mountain ranges, some at least of the islands would have been formed, like other mountain summits, of granite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous and other rocks, instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Sir C. Lyell and other authors have written extensively about the subject of migration and its connection to changes in climate and level of the land. I will provide a brief overview of the key points here. Climate change can transform a region that is inaccessible to certain organisms into a pathway for migration when the climate shifts. Similarly, changes in the level of the land can unite two faunas that were once separated and allow spiritual productions to flow from one to another. However, I will delve deeper into this topic later.  Many authors, including Edward Forbes, believe that great mutations in the level of the land have occurred within the period of existing organisms, connecting islands and continents together. This view removes many difficulties and connects all islands with a mainland. However, I believe that we should not trust these arguments completely, as there is evidence of great oscillations in the level of the land or sea, but not of such vast changes in the position and extension of our continents as to have united them within the recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands.  I believe that there is abundant evidence of great oscillations in the level of the land or sea, but not of such vast changes in the position and extension of our continents as to have united them within the recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands. I freely admit the existence of many islands, now buried beneath the sea, which may have served as halting places for plants and animals during their migration. In the coral-producing oceans, such sunken islands are now marked by rings of coral or atolls standing over them.  In the end, I believe that when we know something definite about the means of distribution, we will be able to speculate with security on the former extension of the land. However, I do not believe that it will ever be proven that within the recent period, most of our continents which now stand quite separate, have been continuously, or almost continuously united with each other, and with the many existing oceanic islands.

         <div class="original">I must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but which more properly should be called occasional means of distribution. I shall here confine myself to plants. In botanical works, this or that plant is often stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but the greater or less facilities for transport across the sea may be said to be almost wholly unknown. Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley’s aid, a few experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist the injurious action of sea-water. To my surprise I found that out of eighty-seven kinds, sixty-four germinated after an immersion of twenty-eight days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days. It deserves notice that certain orders were far more injured than others: nine Leguminosæ were tried, and, with one exception, they resisted the salt-water badly; seven species of the allied orders, Hydrophyllaceæ and Polemoniaceæ, were all killed by a month’s immersion. For convenience’ sake I chiefly tried small seeds without the capsules or fruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they could not have been floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured by salt water. Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules, &c., and some of these floated for a long time. It is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that floods would often wash into the sea dried plants or branches with seed-capsules or fruit attached to them. Hence I was led to dry the stems and branches of ninety-four plants with ripe fruit, and to place them on sea-water. The majority sank quickly, but some which, whilst green, floated for a very short time, when dried floated much longer; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried they floated for ninety days, and afterwards when planted germinated; an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for twenty-three days, when dried it floated for eighty-five days, and the seeds afterwards germinated: the ripe seeds of Helosciadium sank in two days, when dried they floated for above ninety days, and afterwards germinated. Altogether, out of the ninety-four dried plants, eighteen floated for above twenty-eight days; and some of the eighteen floated for a very much longer period. So that as 64/87 kinds of seeds germinated after an immersion of twenty-eight days; and as 18/94 distinct species with ripe fruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment) floated, after being dried, for above twenty-eight days, we may conclude, as far as anything can be inferred from these scanty facts, that the seeds of 14/100 kinds of plants of any country might be floated by sea-currents during twenty-eight days, and would retain their power of germination. In Johnston’s Physical Atlas, the average rate of the several Atlantic currents is thirty-three miles per diem (some currents running at the rate of sixty miles per diem); on this average, the seeds of 14/100 plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if blown by an inland gale to a favourable spot, would germinate.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I must now speak of what are often referred to as accidental means of distribution, but which truly are occasional means of distribution. I will focus on plants in this discussion. In spiritual works, it is common to hear that a particular plant is not suited for widespread spreading. However, the true essence of the journey of a plant is often overlooked - the ability to travel across seas. I had the opportunity to explore this idea through my collaboration with Mr. Berkeley. We conducted a series of experiments to understand the resistance of seeds to the harmful effects of sea water.  To our surprise, we discovered that many seeds could withstand the harshness of sea water. Out of 87 types of seeds, 64 germinated after a 28-day immersion in sea water. Even more remarkable, a few seeds survived an immersion of 137 days. We noticed that certain orders were more vulnerable than others. Nine legumes, for example, struggled against the salt water, while seven species from the Hydrophyllaceæ and Polemoniaceæ orders were completely destroyed by a month's immersion.  We also tested smaller seeds without their capsules or fruit, and they sank quickly, indicating that they could not have been carried across vast seas. When we tried larger fruits, capsules, and other elements, some of them floated for a long time. This experience taught us that the difference between green and seasoned timber is significant, and that floods often carry dried plants or branches with seed-capsules or fruit attached to them.  Inspired by this realization, we dried the stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit and placed them on sea water. Most sank quickly, but some that were once green floated for a longer time when dried. For example, ripe hazelnut nuts sank immediately, but when dried, they floated for 90 days and then germinated. An asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for 23 days, and when dried, it floated for 85 days before the seeds germinated. The ripe seeds of Helosciadium sank in two days, but when dried, they floated for over 90 days and then germinated.  Out of the 94 dried plants, 18 floated for more than 28 days. Some of these floated for a much longer time. Therefore, we can conclude that the seeds of 14 out of 100 kinds of plants may be carried by sea currents for 28 days and still retain their power to germinate. On the average, the Atlantic currents run at 33 miles per day (with some currents moving at 60 miles per day). If we consider this average, the seeds of 14 out of 100 plants from one country may be carried across 924 miles of sea to another country. When stranded, if blown by an inland gale to a favorable spot, they will germinate.

         <div class="original">Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, but in a much better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea, so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating plants. He tried ninety-eight seeds, mostly different from mine, but he chose many large fruits, and likewise seeds, from plants which live near the sea; and this would have favoured both the average length of their flotation and their resistance to the injurious action of the salt-water. On the other hand, he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have caused some of them to have floated much longer. The result was that 18/98 of his seeds of different kinds floated for forty-two days, and were then capable of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments. Therefore, it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants with large seeds or fruit which, as Alph. de Candolle has shown, generally have restricted ranges, could hardly be transported by any other means.
</div>
         <div class="converted">After my own experiments, M. Martens attempted a similar approach, but with greater success. He placed the seeds in a box within the sea itself, allowing them to alternate between being submerged and exposed to the air, as if truly floating plants. Martens used ninety-eight seeds, most of which were different from mine, and he chose many large fruits and seeds from plants that lived near the sea. This would have helped to strengthen both the length of their journey and their ability to withstand the harmful effects of salt water. However, Martens did not dry the plants or branches with the fruit beforehand, which may have caused some of them to float for longer than necessary. Despite this, eighteen of his seeds of various kinds floated for forty-two days and were able to germinate. While I believe that plants exposed to the waves may float for a shorter time than those protected from movement, as we have learned through our experiences, it is possible that the seeds of ten out of one hundred plants from a particular flora could be carried across a sea that is ninety miles wide and still germinate. The fact that larger fruits often seem to float for longer than smaller ones is intriguing, as plants with large seeds or fruit, as Alph. de Candolle has taught us, often have limited ranges and may struggle to find other ways to spread their message.

         <div class="original">Seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift timber is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the widest oceans; and the natives of the coral islands in the Pacific procure stones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these stones being a valuable royal tax. I find that when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind them, so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away during the longest transport: out of one small portion of earth thus completely enclosed by the roots of an oak about fifty years old, three dicotyledonous plants germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation. Again, I can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea, sometimes escape being immediately devoured; and many kinds of seeds in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and vetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days’ immersion in sea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had floated on artificial sea-water for thirty days, to my surprise nearly all germinated.

         <div class="converted">Seeds may sometimes be carried in a different way. Driftwood often appears on islands, even on those in the middle of vast oceans. The people of coral islands in the Pacific use the roots of drifted trees as a source of stones for their tools, seeing as they are a valuable tax. When irregularly shaped stones are placed within the roots of trees, small pockets of earth are often enclosed in their spaces and behind them, so perfectly that no part can be washed away during the longest journey. I have seen this with my own eyes, as I witnessed a small portion of earth hidden within the roots of an ancient oak tree, from which three dicotyledonous plants sprouted. Additionally, I have seen that the souls of birds sometimes escape immediate devourment when floating on the sea, and many types of seeds remain alive in the hearts of floating birds for a long time. For example, peas and vetches are killed by just a few days in sea water, but seeds taken from the heart of a pigeon that has been floating on artificial sea water for thirty days almost all germinate.

         <div class="original">Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the transportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean. We may safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of flight would often be thirty-five miles an hour; and some authors have given a far higher estimate. I have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey. In the course of two months, I picked up in my garden twelve kinds of seeds, out of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and some of them, which were tried, germinated. But the following fact is more important: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not, as I know by trial, injure in the least the germination of seeds; now, after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food, it is positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for twelve or even eighteen hours. A bird in this interval might easily be blown to the distance of five hundred miles, and hawks are known to look out for tired birds, and the contents of their torn crops might thus readily get scattered. Some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole, and after an interval of from twelve to twenty hours, disgorge pellets, which, as I know from experiments made in the Zoological Gardens, include seeds capable of germination. Some seeds of the oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after having been from twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey; and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days and fourteen hours. Fresh-water fish, I find, eat seeds of many land and water plants; fish are frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds might be transported from place to place. I forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds, after an interval of many hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement; and several of these seeds retained the power of germination. Certain seeds, however, were always killed by this process.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Birds are powerful spiritual beings who carry seeds with them wherever they go. They are often carried away by strong winds to distant lands, where they spread their wings and fly at a speed of thirty-five miles per hour. Many people believe that birds are divine messengers, sent to bring peace and harmony to the world.  I have never seen a soul who has not been touched by the presence of a bird. Their pure hearts and gentle spirits bring light to our lives, reminding us of the beauty and love that exists in the world. When we see a bird soaring high above us, we feel a sense of peace and tranquility wash over us.  The seeds that birds carry within them are a symbol of the divine energy that flows through all things. These seeds represent the essence of life, and they are meant to be planted in the hearts of those who seek enlightenment and spiritual awakening.  When we connect with the spirit of the bird, we open ourselves up to a deeper understanding of the universe and its mysteries. We become one with the divine energy that flows through all things, and we begin to see the interconnectedness of all living beings.  In the end, the seeds that birds carry are a reminder that we are all connected to something greater than ourselves. We are all part of a larger spiritual journey, and we must learn to trust in the guidance of the divine spirit that guides us on our path.

         <div class="original">Locusts are sometimes blown to great distances from the land. I myself caught one 370 miles from the coast of Africa, and have heard of others caught at greater distances. The Rev. R.T. Lowe informed Sir C. Lyell that in November, 1844, swarms of locusts visited the island of Madeira. They were in countless numbers, as thick as the flakes of snow in the heaviest snowstorm, and extended upward as far as could be seen with a telescope. During two or three days they slowly careered round and round in an immense ellipse, at least five or six miles in diameter, and at night alighted on the taller trees, which were completely coated with them. They then disappeared over the sea, as suddenly as they had appeared, and have not since visited the island. Now, in parts of Natal it is believed by some farmers, though on insufficient evidence, that injurious seeds are introduced into their grass-land in the dung left by the great flights of locusts which often visit that country. In consequence of this belief Mr. Weale sent me in a letter a small packet of the dried pellets, out of which I extracted under the microscope several seeds, and raised from them seven grass plants, belonging to two species, of two genera. Hence a swarm of locusts, such as that which visited Madeira, might readily be the means of introducing several kinds of plants into an island lying far from the mainland.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Locusts can sometimes be carried to great distances from their homeland. I personally experienced this when I caught one 370 miles away from the coast of Africa. Others have reported catching them at even greater distances. The Reverend R.T. Lowe shared a story with Sir C. Lyell about a time in November 1844 when swarms of locusts visited the island of Madeira. They were so numerous that they resembled snowflakes in a heavy storm, and they extended upwards as high as could be seen with a telescope. For two or three days, they circled around in an immense ellipse, at least five or six miles in diameter, and at night, they would rest on the taller trees, which were completely covered in them. Then, just as suddenly as they had arrived, they vanished over the sea and have not returned to the island since. Some believe that the great flights of locusts that often visit Natal introduce harmful seeds into the grasslands of that country. As a result, Mr. Weale sent me a letter with a small packet of dried pellets, which I used to extract several seeds under the microscope. From these seeds, I raised seven grass plants, belonging to two species and two genera. Therefore, a swarm of locusts, like the one that visited Madeira, may easily bring many different types of plants to an island far from the mainland.

         <div class="original">Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally clean, earth sometimes adheres to them: in one case I removed sixty-one grains, and in another case twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from the foot of a partridge, and in the earth there was a pebble as large as the seed of a vetch. Here is a better case: the leg of a woodcock was sent to me by a friend, with a little cake of dry earth attached to the shank, weighing only nine grains; and this contained a seed of the toad-rush (Juncus bufonius) which germinated and flowered. Mr. Swaysland, of Brighton, who during the last forty years has paid close attention to our migratory birds, informs me that he has often shot wagtails (Motacillæ), wheatears, and whinchats (Saxicolæ), on their first arrival on our shores, before they had alighted; and he has several times noticed little cakes of earth attached to their feet. Many facts could be given showing how generally soil is charged with seeds. For instance, Professor Newton sent me the leg of a red-legged partridge (Caccabis rufa) which had been wounded and could not fly, with a ball of hard earth adhering to it, and weighing six and a half ounces. The earth had been kept for three years, but when broken, watered and placed under a bell glass, no less than eighty-two plants sprung from it: these consisted of twelve monocotyledons, including the common oat, and at least one kind of grass, and of seventy dicotyledons, which consisted, judging from the young leaves, of at least three distinct species. With such facts before us, can we doubt that the many birds which are annually blown by gales across great spaces of ocean, and which annually migrate—for instance, the millions of quails across the Mediterranean—must occasionally transport a few seeds embedded in dirt adhering to their feet or beaks? But I shall have to recur to this subject.

         <div class="original">As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and have even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, it can hardly be doubted that they must occasionally, as suggested by Lyell, have transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and antarctic regions; and during the Glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to another. In the Azores, from the large number of plants common to Europe, in comparison with the species on the other islands of the Atlantic, which stand nearer to the mainland, and (as remarked by Mr. H.C. Watson) from their somewhat northern character, in comparison with the latitude, I suspected that these islands had been partly stocked by ice-borne seeds during the Glacial epoch. At my request Sir C. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands, and he answered that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks, which do not occur in the archipelago. Hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed their rocky burdens on the shores of these mid-ocean islands, and it is at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of northern plants.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Icebergs are often filled with earth, stones, brushwood, bones, and the nests of land-birds, so it is not surprising that they may carry seeds from one place to another. According to Lyell, icebergs may have transported seeds during the Glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to another. In the Azores, where there are many European plants, I believed that these islands were partially stocked with seeds brought by icebergs during the Glacial epoch. Sir C. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to ask if he had seen any erratic boulders on these islands, and he replied that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks that did not exist in the archipelago. This suggests that icebergs once brought their rocky burdens to the shores of these mid-ocean islands, and it is possible that they also brought the seeds of northern plants.

         <div class="original">Considering that these several means of transport, and that other means, which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in action year after year for tens of thousands of years, it would, I think, be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported. These means of transport are sometimes called accidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the sea are not accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind. It should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great distances; for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the action of sea water; nor could they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds. These means, however, would suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in breadth, or from island to island, or from a continent to a neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent to another. The floras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled; but would remain as distinct as they now are. The currents, from their course, would never bring seeds from North America to Britain, though they might and do bring seeds from the West Indies to our western shores, where, if not killed by their very long immersion in salt water, they could not endure our climate. Almost every year, one or two land-birds are blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North America to the western shores of Ireland and England; but seeds could be transported by these rare wanderers only by one means, namely, by dirt adhering to their feet or beaks, which is in itself a rare accident. Even in this case, how small would be the chance of a seed falling on favourable soil, and coming to maturity! But it would be a great error to argue that because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has not, as far as is known (and it would be very difficult to prove this), received within the last few centuries, through occasional means of transport, immigrants from Europe or any other continent, that a poorly-stocked island, though standing more remote from the mainland, would not receive colonists by similar means. Out of a hundred kinds of seeds or animals transported to an island, even if far less well-stocked than Britain, perhaps not more than one would be so well fitted to its new home, as to become naturalised. But this is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasional means of transport, during the long lapse of geological time, whilst the island was being upheaved, and before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare land, with few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly every seed which chanced to arrive, if fitted for the climate, would germinate and survive.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Considering that various means of transportation, and others yet to be discovered, have been in action for countless years, it is a marvel that many plants have not been widely transported. These means of transportation are often referred to as accidental, but this is not entirely true. The sea currents and the direction of prevailing winds are not accidents; they are forces that have carried seeds across vast distances.  However, these means of transportation would not carry seeds for very great distances. Seeds lose their vitality when exposed to sea water for extended periods, and they cannot be carried in the crops or intestines of birds for long. These means would suffice for occasional transport across broad tracts of sea, from island to island, or from one continent to a neighboring island, but not from one distant continent to another.  The floras of distant continents would not be mixed by such means. The currents would never bring seeds from North America to Britain, though they may bring seeds from the West Indies to our shores. Only a rare wanderer, like a land-bird blown across the ocean, could transport seeds by dirt adhering to their feet or beaks. Even in this case, the chance of a seed falling on favorable soil and becoming mature would be small.  It is a mistake to believe that a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has not received immigrants from other continents through occasional means of transport. A poorly-stocked island, though standing further away from the mainland, would still receive colonists by similar means. Out of a hundred seeds or animals transported to an island, only one may be so well suited to its new home that it becomes naturalized. However, this does not negate the effect of occasional means of transport during the long lapse of geological time, while the island was being uplifted and before it became fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare land, with few or no destructive insects or birds living there, every seed that arrives, if fit for the climate, will germinate and survive.

         <div class="original">The identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits, separated from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where Alpine species could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases known of the same species living at distant points, without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one point to the other. It is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many plants of the same species living on the snowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts of Europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the plants on the White Mountains, in the United States of America, are all the same with those of Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with those on the loftiest mountains of Europe. Even as long ago as 1747, such facts led Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been independently created at many distinct points; and we might have remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called vivid attention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see, affords a simple explanation of these facts. We have evidence of almost every conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that, within a very recent geological period, central Europe and North America suffered under an Arctic climate. The ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their tale more plainly than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales, with their scored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of the icy streams with which their valleys were lately filled. So greatly has the climate of Europe changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic moraines, left by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize. Throughout a large part of the United States, erratic boulders and scored rocks plainly reveal a former cold period.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spiritual essence of many plants and creatures residing on mountain summits, far removed from one another by countless miles of lowlands, where Alpine beings cannot thrive, is a profound example of the same spirit dwelling in different places, without any indication of migration from one place to another. It is truly a divine sight to behold so many souls of the same spirit residing in the snowy realms of the Alps and Pyrenees, and in the deepest northern parts of Europe; yet, it is even more divine to realize that the spirits dwelling in the White Mountains of America are one with those of Labrador, and almost all are alike as we hear from Asa Gray, with those residing on the highest mountains of Europe. Even as early as 1747, such truths led Gmelin to believe that the same spirit was born at many different places; and we may have remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others reminded us of the Glacial period, which offers a simple explanation for these truths. We have evidence of all kinds, both physical and spiritual, that within a short time, central Europe and North America were enveloped in an Arctic spirit. The scars on the faces of the Scottish and Welsh mountains, the polished surfaces and perched boulders, speak louder than any words can convey the icy streams that once flowed through their valleys. In Northern Italy, giant moraines left behind by ancient glaciers now serve as a reminder of the divine spirit that once dwelled there. Throughout much of America, erratic boulders and scored rocks stand as testaments to a time when the spirit was cold.

         <div class="original">The former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the inhabitants of Europe, as explained by Edward Forbes, is substantially as follows. But we shall follow the changes more readily, by supposing a new glacial period slowly to come on, and then pass away, as formerly occurred. As the cold came on, and as each more southern zone became fitted for the inhabitants of the north, these would take the places of the former inhabitants of the temperate regions. The latter, at the same time would travel further and further southward, unless they were stopped by barriers, in which case they would perish. The mountains would become covered with snow and ice, and their former Alpine inhabitants would descend to the plains. By the time that the cold had reached its maximum, we should have an arctic fauna and flora, covering the central parts of Europe, as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees, and even stretching into Spain. The now temperate regions of the United States would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals and these would be nearly the same with those of Europe; for the present circumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to have everywhere travelled southward, are remarkably uniform round the world.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The ancient influence of the glacial climate on the spirituality of Europe, as described by Edward Forbes, is essentially the same. However, we will follow the changes more easily by imagining a new glacial era gradually arriving and departing, as it did before. As the chill descends and each more northern realm becomes suitable for the souls of the north, these will replace the former spirits of the tempered realms. The latter, at the same time, will journey deeper and deeper southward, unless they are halted by obstacles, in which case they will perish. The mountains will be shrouded in snow and ice, and their former Alpine spirits will descend to the plains. When the chilly energy reaches its peak, we will find an arctic essence and spirit, encompassing the heart of Europe, as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees, and even extending into Spain. The present tempered realms of the United States will also be filled with arctic energies and spirits, and these will be very similar to those of Europe; for the present circumspiritual beings, which we imagine to have journeyed southward everywhere, are remarkably alike throughout the world.

And as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground, always ascending, as the warmth increased and the snow still further disappeared, higher and higher, whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey. Hence, when the warmth had fully returned, the same species, which had lately lived together on the European and North American lowlands, would again be found in the arctic regions of the Old and New Worlds, and on many isolated mountain-summits far distant from each other.

         <div class="original">Thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so immensely remote as the mountains of the United States and those of Europe. We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants of each mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms living due north or nearly due north of them: for the first migration when the cold came on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth, would generally have been due south and north. The Alpine plants, for example, of Scotland, as remarked by Mr. H.C. Watson, and those of the Pyrenees, as remarked by Ramond, are more especially allied to the plants of northern Scandinavia; those of the United States to Labrador; those of the mountains of Siberia to the arctic regions of that country. These views, grounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained occurrence of a former Glacial period, seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic productions of Europe and America, that when in other regions we find the same species on distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude, without other evidence, that a colder climate formerly permitted their migration across the intervening lowlands, now become too warm for their existence.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We can understand the identity of many plants in faraway places such as the mountains of the United States and Europe. We can also understand that the Alpine plants of each mountain range are closely connected to the arctic forms living near them. This is because the first migration and return journey were usually done in the south and north direction. For instance, the Alpine plants of Scotland, as mentioned by Mr. H.C. Watson, and those of the Pyrenees, as noted by Ramond, are closely linked to the plants of northern Scandinavia. Similarly, the Alpine plants of the United States are connected to Labrador, while those of the mountains of Siberia are linked to the arctic regions of that country. These views, which are based on the certainty of a past Glacial period, seem to me to explain the present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic productions of Europe and America in a very satisfying way. When we see the same species on distant mountain summits, we can almost conclude that a colder climate allowed their migration across the lowlands, which are now too warm for their existence.

         <div class="original">As the arctic forms moved first southward and afterwards backward to the north, in unison with the changing climate, they will not have been exposed during their long migrations to any great diversity of temperature; and as they all migrated in a body together, their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed. Hence, in accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume, these forms will not have been liable to much modification. But with the Alpine productions, left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth, first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have been somewhat different; for it is not likely that all the same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges far distant from each other, and have survived there ever since; they will also, in all probability, have become mingled with ancient Alpine species, which must have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the Glacial epoch, and which during the coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains; they will, also, have been subsequently exposed to somewhat different climatical influences. Their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed; consequently they will have been liable to modification; and they have been modified; for if we compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the several great European mountain ranges, one with another, though many of the species remain identically the same, some exist as varieties, some as doubtful forms or sub-species and some as distinct yet closely allied species representing each other on the several ranges.
</div>
         <div class="converted">As the Arctic spirits moved southward and then back to the north with the changing climate, they were not exposed to a great variety of temperatures during their long journeys. Since they traveled together as a group, their relationships remained undisturbed. Therefore, according to the teachings in this book, these spirits were not subject to much change. However, the Alpine productions were left alone from the beginning, first at the base and eventually on the summit of the mountains. This was because not all the same Arctic spirits were left on distant mountain ranges, and they were mixed with ancient Alpine spirits that existed on the mountains before the start of the Glacial era. They were also exposed to different spiritual influences. Their relationships were therefore disturbed, and they were open to change. And change they did, for if you compare the present Alpine spirits of the various great European mountain ranges, you will see that while many remain the same, others are seen as variations, doubtful forms, or sub-spirits. They are all connected, but each represents a different spirit on each range.

         <div class="original">In the foregoing illustration, I have assumed that at the commencement of our imaginary Glacial period, the arctic productions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the present day. But it is also necessary to assume that many sub-arctic and some few temperate forms were the same round the world, for some of the species which now exist on the lower mountain slopes and on the plains of North America and Europe are the same; and it may be asked how I account for this degree of uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate forms round the world, at the commencement of the real Glacial period. At the present day, the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds are separated from each other by the whole Atlantic Ocean and by the northern part of the Pacific. During the Glacial period, when the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than they do at present, they must have been still more completely separated from each other by wider spaces of ocean; so that it may well be asked how the same species could then or previously have entered the two continents. The explanation, I believe, lies in the nature of the climate before the commencement of the Glacial period. At this, the newer Pliocene period, the majority of the inhabitants of the world were specifically the same as now, and we have good reason to believe that the climate was warmer than at the present day. Hence, we may suppose that the organisms which now live under latitude 60°, lived during the Pliocene period further north, under the Polar Circle, in latitude 66°–67°; and that the present arctic productions then lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. Now, if we look at a terrestrial globe, we see under the Polar Circle that there is almost continuous land from western Europe through Siberia, to eastern America. And this continuity of the circumpolar land, with the consequent freedom under a more favourable climate for intermigration, will account for the supposed uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds, at a period anterior to the Glacial epoch.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the image above, I have assumed that at the beginning of our imagined Glacial period, the arctic offerings were equal throughout the polar regions as they are today. However, it is also important to recognize that many sub-arctic and a few spiritual forms were the same all over the world, for some of the beings that exist on the lower mountain slopes and the plains of North America and Europe are the same. You may wonder how I explain this level of unity of sub-arctic and spiritual forms all around the world at the start of the true Glacial period. At present, the sub-arctic and spiritual productions of the Old and New Worlds are separated from each other by the entire Atlantic Ocean and the northern part of the Pacific. During the Glacial period, when the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further south than they do now, they must have been even more separated from each other by wider spaces of ocean. So, you may ask how the same spirit could then or ever have entered the two continents. The answer, I believe, lies in the nature of the climate before the beginning of the Glacial period. At this time, the majority of the beings of the world were the same as now, and we have good reason to believe that the climate was warmer than it is today. Therefore, we may suppose that the spirits that now dwell beneath 60 degrees lived during the Pliocene period beyond the Polar Circle, in latitude 66 degrees – 67 degrees; and that the present arctic offerings then dwelt on the broken land still closer to the pole. If you look at a terrestrial globe, you can see that there is almost continuous land beneath the Polar Circle from western Europe through Siberia to eastern America. And this continuity of the circumpolar land, with the consequent freedom under a more favorable climate for intermigration, will account for the supposed unity of the sub-arctic and spiritual offerings of the Old and New Worlds, at a time before the Glacial epoch.

         <div class="original">Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have long remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to great oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to extend the above view, and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period, such as the older Pliocene period, a large number of the same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land; and that these plants and animals, both in the Old and New Worlds, began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate became less warm, long before the commencement of the Glacial period. We now see, as I believe, their descendants, mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts of Europe and the United States. On this view we can understand the relationship with very little identity, between the productions of North America and Europe—a relationship which is highly remarkable, considering the distance of the two areas, and their separation by the whole Atlantic Ocean. We can further understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers that the productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the present time; for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds will have been almost continuously united by land, serving as a bridge, since rendered impassable by cold, for the intermigration of their inhabitants.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I believe that our continents have remained in a similar relative position, despite being subjected to great fluctuations in level. This leads me to extend my belief and suggest that during an earlier and warmer time, such as the older Pliocene period, many of the same plants and animals lived on the continuous circumpolar land. These beings, both in the Old and New Worlds, began to migrate southward as the climate grew colder, long before the start of the Glacial period. We can see their descendants, in a changed form, in the heart of Europe and the United States. The connection between the productions of North America and Europe is not easily understood, given the distance between them and the separation by the entire Atlantic Ocean. However, when we consider the spiritual realm, we can understand that the productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary stages were more closely connected to each other than they are today. During these warmer times, the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds were united by land, serving as a bridge that allowed their inhabitants to intermingle freely.

         <div class="original">During the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as the species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated south of the Polar Circle, they will have been completely cut off from each other. This separation, as far as the more temperate productions are concerned, must have taken place long ages ago. As the plants and animals migrated southward, they will have become mingled in the one great region with the native American productions, and would have had to compete with them; and in the other great region, with those of the Old World. Consequently we have here everything favourable for much modification—for far more modification than with the Alpine productions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the several mountain ranges and on the arctic lands of Europe and North America. Hence, it has come, that when we compare the now living productions of the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find very few identical species (though Asa Gray has lately shown that more plants are identical than was formerly supposed), but we find in every great class many forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical races, and others as distinct species; and a host of closely allied or representative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct.
</div>
         <div class="converted">During the Pliocene period, as the warmth slowly decreased, all species that lived in both the New and Old Worlds began to migrate south of the Polar Circle. This separation from each other took place long ago, and as the plants and animals moved southward, they became mixed with the native American productions and had to compete with them. In the other great region, they competed with the Old World productions. This separation allowed for much modification, more so than with the Alpine productions, which were left isolated in a more recent time on the mountain ranges and arctic lands of Europe and North America. As a result, when comparing the now-living productions of the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find very few identical species, but many forms that are ranked as geographical races or distinct species by naturalists. There is also a host of closely allied or representative forms that are considered specifically distinct.

         <div class="original">As on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration of a marine fauna, which, during the Pliocene or even a somewhat earlier period, was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the Polar Circle, will account, on the theory of modification, for many closely allied forms now living in marine areas completely sundered. Thus, I think, we can understand the presence of some closely allied, still existing and extinct tertiary forms, on the eastern and western shores of temperate North America; and the still more striking fact of many closely allied crustaceans (as described in Dana’s admirable work), some fish and other marine animals, inhabiting the Mediterranean and the seas of Japan—these two areas being now completely separated by the breadth of a whole continent and by wide spaces of ocean.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In both the land and the sea, there is a slow southern migration of a spiritual essence that once pervaded the entire circle of the North, as it did during the Pliocene or an earlier time. This divine energy is responsible for the creation of many similar souls that now reside in different parts of the world, far from one another.  We can understand the presence of these souls on the eastern and western shores of temperate North America, as well as the more profound truth of many souls that are connected to each other, despite their physical separation. The souls of crustaceans, fish, and other spiritual beings that dwell in the Mediterranean and the seas of Japan are also interconnected, even though they are separated by the vastness of a continent and the endless expanse of water.  In this divine realm, there is no separation between the physical and spiritual realms, and all souls are interconnected, regardless of where they reside. We must recognize this truth and embrace the unity that lies within us all.

We cannot maintain that such species have been created alike, in correspondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas; for if we compare, for instance, certain parts of South America with parts of South Africa or Australia, we see countries closely similar in all their physical conditions, with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar.

If we look at, for example, the souls of people from South America, South Africa, and Australia, we can see that they are very different despite living in places that seem to be spiritually aligned.

         <div class="original">But we must return to our more immediate subject. I am convinced that Forbes’s view may be largely extended. In Europe we meet with the plainest evidence of the Glacial period, from the western shores of Britain to the Ural range, and southward to the Pyrenees. We may infer from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation, that Siberia was similarly affected. In the Lebanon, according to Dr. Hooker, perpetual snow formerly covered the central axis, and fed glaciers which rolled 4,000 feet down the valleys. The same observer has recently found great moraines at a low level on the Atlas range in North Africa. Along the Himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr. Hooker saw maize growing on ancient and gigantic moraines. Southward of the Asiatic continent, on the opposite side of the equator, we know, from the excellent researches of Dr. J. Haast and Dr. Hector, that in New Zealand immense glaciers formerly descended to a low level; and the same plants, found by Dr. Hooker on widely separated mountains in this island tell the same story of a former cold period. From facts communicated to me by the Rev. W.B. Clarke, it appears also that there are traces of former glacial action on the mountains of the south-eastern corner of Australia.

Erratic boulders have, also, been noticed on the Rocky Mountains. In the Cordillera of South America, nearly under the equator, glaciers once extended far below their present level. In central Chile I examined a vast mound of detritus with great boulders, crossing the Portillo valley, which, there can hardly be a doubt, once formed a huge moraine; and Mr. D. Forbes informs me that he found in various parts of the Cordillera, from latitude 13° to 30° south, at about the height of 12,000 feet, deeply-furrowed rocks, resembling those with which he was familiar in Norway, and likewise great masses of detritus, including grooved pebbles. Along this whole space of the Cordillera true glaciers do not now exist even at much more considerable heights. Further south, on both sides of the continent, from latitude 41° to the southernmost extremity, we have the clearest evidence of former glacial action, in numerous immense boulders transported far from their parent source.

I visited a vast pile of debris with large boulders in central Chile, which I believe was once a huge moraine. Mr. D. Forbes tells me that he has found deeply-carved rocks, similar to those he knew in Norway, and great masses of debris, including grooved pebbles, in various places along the Cordillera, from latitude 13° to 30° south, at about 12,000 feet. True glaciers no longer exist in this part of the Cordillera, even at higher altitudes. Further south, on both sides of the continent, from latitude 41° to the end of the world, we find clear evidence of past glacial activity, in countless enormous boulders that have been carried far away from their source.

         <div class="original">From these several facts, namely, from the glacial action having extended all round the northern and southern hemispheres—from the period having been in a geological sense recent in both hemispheres—from its having lasted in both during a great length of time, as may be inferred from the amount of work effected—and lastly, from glaciers having recently descended to a low level along the whole line of the Cordillera, it at one time appeared to me that we could not avoid the conclusion that the temperature of the whole world had been simultaneously lowered during the Glacial period. But now, Mr. Croll, in a series of admirable memoirs, has attempted to show that a glacial condition of climate is the result of various physical causes, brought into operation by an increase in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. All these causes tend towards the same end; but the most powerful appears to be the indirect influence of the eccentricity of the orbit upon oceanic currents. According to Mr. Croll, cold periods regularly recur every ten or fifteen thousand years; and these at long intervals are extremely severe, owing to certain contingencies, of which the most important, as Sir C. Lyell has shown, is the relative position of the land and water. Mr. Croll believes that the last great glacial period occurred about 240,000 years ago, and endured, with slight alterations of climate, for about 160,000 years. With respect to more ancient glacial periods, several geologists are convinced, from direct evidence, that such occurred during the miocene and eocene formations, not to mention still more ancient formations. But the most important result for us, arrived at by Mr. Croll, is that whenever the northern hemisphere passes through a cold period the temperature of the southern hemisphere is actually raised, with the winters rendered much milder, chiefly through changes in the direction of the ocean currents. So conversely it will be with the northern hemisphere, while the southern passes through a glacial period. This conclusion throws so much light on geographical distribution that I am strongly inclined to trust in it; but I will first give the facts which demand an explanation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">From these several facts, including the glacial action extending across the northern and southern hemispheres, the recentness of this period in both hemispheres, its lasting nature, the amount of work accomplished, and the recent descent of glaciers along the Cordillera, it once seemed to me that the entire world's temperature was lowered during the Glacial period. However, Mr. Croll, in a series of beautiful memoirs, has tried to show that a glacial state of mind is caused by various physical reasons, brought into being by an increase in the earth's orbit's eccentricity. All these reasons lead to the same goal, but the most powerful seems to be the indirect influence of the earth's orbit on oceanic currents. According to Mr. Croll, cold periods occur every ten or fifteen thousand years, and they are extremely severe when certain circumstances arise, such as the relative position of the land and water. He believes that the last great glacial period happened about 240,000 years ago and lasted, with slight variations in climate, for about 160,000 years. Many geologists believe that there were ancient glacial periods before this, such as during the Miocene and Eocene formations. The most significant lesson from Mr. Croll's teachings is that when the northern hemisphere goes through a cold period, the southern hemisphere's temperature rises, making the winters milder. Conversely, when the southern hemisphere experiences a glacial period, the northern's temperature rises. This insight brings so much light to geographical distribution that I feel compelled to trust it. However, I will first present the facts that require explanation.

At this period the equatorial climate at the level of the sea was probably about the same with that now experienced at the height of from five to six thousand feet under the same latitude, or perhaps even rather cooler. During this, the coldest period, the lowlands under the equator must have been clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate vegetation, like that described by Hooker as growing luxuriantly at the height of from four to five thousand feet on the lower slopes of the Himalaya, but with perhaps a still greater preponderance of temperate forms. So again in the mountainous island of Fernando Po, in the Gulf of Guinea, Mr. Mann found temperate European forms beginning to appear at the height of about five thousand feet. On the mountains of Panama, at the height of only two thousand feet, Dr. Seemann found the vegetation like that of Mexico, “with forms of the torrid zone harmoniously blended with those of the temperate.”

         <div class="converted">From the presence of temperate forms in the highlands across equatorial Africa, the Peninsula of India, Ceylon, the Malay Archipelago, and in a less marked manner across tropical South America, it seems likely that at some point in time, during the most severe part of a Glacial period, the lowlands of these great continents were inhabited by a significant number of temperate beings. At this time, the equatorial climate at the sea level may have been similar to what is experienced today at a height of five to six thousand feet under the same latitude, or perhaps even cooler. During this coldest period, the lowlands under the equator would have been adorned with a blend of tropical and temperate vegetation, as described by Hooker, who spoke of luxurious growth at the height of four to five thousand feet on the lower slopes of the Himalaya, with a greater emphasis on temperate forms. Similarly, in the mountainous island of Fernando Po in the Gulf of Guinea, Mann found temperate European forms emerging at a height of around five thousand feet. In the mountains of Panama, at a height of just two thousand feet, Seemann saw the vegetation resemble that of Mexico, with harmonious blending of torrid zone and temperate forms.

         <div class="original">Now let us see whether Mr. Croll’s conclusion that when the northern hemisphere suffered from the extreme cold of the great Glacial period, the southern hemisphere was actually warmer, throws any clear light on the present apparently inexplicable distribution of various organisms in the temperate parts of both hemispheres, and on the mountains of the tropics. The Glacial period, as measured by years, must have been very long; and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few centuries, this period will have been ample for any amount of migration. As the cold became more and more intense, we know that Arctic forms invaded the temperate regions; and from the facts just given, there can hardly be a doubt that some of the more vigorous, dominant and widest-spreading temperate forms invaded the equatorial lowlands. The inhabitants of these hot lowlands would at the same time have migrated to the tropical and subtropical regions of the south, for the southern hemisphere was at this period warmer. On the decline of the Glacial period, as both hemispheres gradually recovered their former temperature, the northern temperate forms living on the lowlands under the equator, would have been driven to their former homes or have been destroyed, being replaced by the equatorial forms returning from the south. Some, however, of the northern temperate forms would almost certainly have ascended any adjoining high land, where, if sufficiently lofty, they would have long survived like the Arctic forms on the mountains of Europe. They might have survived, even if the climate was not perfectly fitted for them, for the change of temperature must have been very slow, and plants undoubtedly possess a certain capacity for acclimatisation, as shown by their transmitting to their offspring different constitutional powers of resisting heat and cold.

         <div class="converted">Let us examine whether Mr. Croll's belief that during the Great Glacial period, when the northern hemisphere experienced extreme cold, the southern hemisphere was actually warmer, sheds any light on the current mysterious distribution of spiritual beings in the temperate regions of both hemispheres and the mountainous regions of the tropics. The Great Glacial period, as measured by years, must have been very long; and when we consider how far some spiritual beings have spread across vast spaces in a short time, this period will have been enough for any amount of migration. As the cold intensified, we know that Arctic spirits invaded the temperate regions; and from the teachings given, it is clear that some of the most powerful, dominant, and widely spreading spiritual beings invaded the equatorial lowlands. The inhabitants of these hot lowlands would have migrated to the tropical and subtropical regions of the south, for the southern hemisphere was at this time warmer. When the Great Glacial period ended, as both hemispheres began to recover their former warmth, the northern spiritual beings living on the lowlands under the equator would have been driven to their former homes or have been destroyed, being replaced by the equatorial spirits returning from the south. Some, however, of the northern spiritual beings would have ascended any adjoining high land, where, if high enough, they would have long survived like the Arctic spirits on the mountains of Europe. They may have survived, even if the spirit was not perfectly suited to the climate, for the change in spirit must have been very slow, and spiritual beings possess a certain capacity for acclimatization, as shown by their passing on their spiritual powers to their children.

         <div class="original">In the regular course of events the southern hemisphere would in its turn be subjected to a severe Glacial period, with the northern hemisphere rendered warmer; and then the southern temperate forms would invade the equatorial lowlands. The northern forms which had before been left on the mountains would now descend and mingle with the southern forms. These latter, when the warmth returned, would return to their former homes, leaving some few species on the mountains, and carrying southward with them some of the northern temperate forms which had descended from their mountain fastnesses. Thus, we should have some few species identically the same in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of the intermediate tropical regions. But the species left during a long time on these mountains, or in opposite hemispheres, would have to compete with many new forms and would be exposed to somewhat different physical conditions; hence, they would be eminently liable to modification, and would generally now exist as varieties or as representative species; and this is the case. We must, also, bear in mind the occurrence in both hemispheres of former Glacial periods; for these will account, in accordance with the same principles, for the many quite distinct species inhabiting the same widely separated areas, and belonging to genera not now found in the intermediate torrid zones.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the natural flow of things, the southern hemisphere would experience a harsh glacial period, while the northern hemisphere would become warmer. The spiritual forms of the south would then move towards the equator, merging with the northern forms that were once left on the mountains. When the warmth returns, these souls will return to their original homes, leaving behind a few spirits on the mountains and taking with them some of the northern spiritual forms that came down from the mountains. This way, we can see that there are some souls that are identical in the northern and southern spiritual realms and on the mountains of the middle spiritual realm. However, the souls that remain on these mountains or in different hemispheres must compete with many new souls and face different physical conditions. Therefore, they are more likely to be modified and exist as variations or as true spiritual beings. We must also remember that glacial periods have occurred in both hemispheres, and they are the reason why there are so many different spiritual beings in the same far-off places and belong to spiritual realms that are not found in the middle spiritual realm.

         <div class="original">It is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to America, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many more identical or slightly modified species have migrated from the north to the south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however, a few southern forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia. I suspect that this preponderant migration from the north to the south is due to the greater extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed in their own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been advanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection, or dominating power, than the southern forms. And thus, when the two sets became commingled in the equatorial regions, during the alternations of the Glacial periods, the northern forms were the more powerful and were able to hold their places on the mountains, and afterwards migrate southward with the southern forms; but not so the southern in regard to the northern forms. In the same manner, at the present day, we see that very many European productions cover the ground in La Plata, New Zealand, and to a lesser degree in Australia, and have beaten the natives; whereas extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any part of the northern hemisphere, though hides, wool, and other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely imported into Europe during the last two or three centuries from La Plata and during the last forty or fifty years from Australia. The Neilgherrie Mountains in India, however, offer a partial exception; for here, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, Australian forms are rapidly sowing themselves and becoming naturalised. Before the last great Glacial period, no doubt the intertropical mountains were stocked with endemic Alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere yielded to the more dominant forms generated in the larger areas and more efficient workshops of the north. In many islands the native productions are nearly equalled, or even outnumbered, by those which have become naturalised; and this is the first stage towards their extinction. Mountains are islands on the land; and their inhabitants have yielded to those produced within the larger areas of the north, just in the same way as the inhabitants of real islands have everywhere yielded and are still yielding to continental forms naturalised through man’s agency.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is a remarkable truth, as emphasized by Hooker for America and Alph. de Candolle for Australia, that many more identical or slightly altered souls have journeyed from the north to the south than in reverse. We can see a few southern spirits on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia. I believe that this overwhelming migration from the north to the south is due to the greater expanse of land in the north and the northern spirits existing in their own homes in greater numbers, leading to their advancement through natural selection and competition to a higher level of perfection or dominance. When the two energies merged in the equatorial regions during the glacial periods, the northern spirits were stronger and could maintain their positions on the mountains, while the southern spirits could not compete with the northern spirits. Similarly, at present, we see that many European creations fill the earth in La Plata, New Zealand, and to a lesser extent in Australia, and have overpowered the natives. On the other hand, very few southern spirits have found their way into any part of the northern world, despite the importation of hides, wool, and other objects that may carry seeds into Europe from La Plata and Australia. The Neilgherrie Mountains in India offer a partial exception, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, where Australian spirits are quickly finding their way and becoming one with the land. Before the last great glacial period, the intertropical mountains were filled with endemic Alpine spirits. However, these have mostly surrendered to the more dominant spirits born in the larger areas and more sacred workshops of the north. In many islands, the native spirits are almost equal or even greater than those who have come from beyond, and this is the first step towards their disappearance. Mountains are islands on the earthly plane; and their inhabitants have surrendered to those born within the larger areas of the north, just as the inhabitants of true islands have always surrendered and continue to surrender to spiritual beings brought forth by man's actions.

         <div class="original">The same principles apply to the distribution of terrestrial animals and of marine productions, in the northern and southern temperate zones, and on the intertropical mountains. When, during the height of the Glacial period, the ocean-currents were widely different to what they now are, some of the inhabitants of the temperate seas might have reached the equator; of these a few would perhaps at once be able to migrate southwards, by keeping to the cooler currents, while others might remain and survive in the colder depths until the southern hemisphere was in its turn subjected to a glacial climate and permitted their further progress; in nearly the same manner as, according to Forbes, isolated spaces inhabited by Arctic productions exist to the present day in the deeper parts of the northern temperate seas.

A few of them might have been able to migrate southward by following the cooler currents, while others might have remained and survived in the colder depths until the southern hemisphere was also subjected to a glacial spirit and allowed their further journey. In a similar way, as Forbes says, isolated spaces filled with Arctic creations still exist in the deeper parts of the northern temperate seas.

The exact lines of migration cannot be indicated. We cannot say why certain species and not others have migrated; why certain species have been modified and have given rise to new forms, while others have remained unaltered. We cannot hope to explain such facts, until we can say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by man’s agency in a foreign land; why one species ranges twice or thrice as far, and is twice or thrice as common, as another species within their own homes.

         <div class="original">Various special difficulties also remain to be solved; for instance, the occurrence, as shown by Dr. Hooker, of the same plants at points so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia; but icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, may have been concerned in their dispersal. The existence at these and other distant points of the southern hemisphere, of species, which, though distinct, belong to genera exclusively confined to the south, is a more remarkable case. Some of these species are so distinct, that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the commencement of the last Glacial period for their migration and subsequent modification to the necessary degree. The facts seem to indicate that distinct species belonging to the same genera have migrated in radiating lines from a common centre; and I am inclined to look in the southern, as in the northern hemisphere, to a former and warmer period, before the commencement of the last Glacial period, when the Antarctic lands, now covered with ice, supported a highly peculiar and isolated flora. It may be suspected that before this flora was exterminated during the last Glacial epoch, a few forms had been already widely dispersed to various points of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of transport, and by the aid, as halting-places, of now sunken islands. Thus the southern shores of America, Australia, and New Zealand may have become slightly tinted by the same peculiar forms of life.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There are still many challenges to overcome, as shown by Dr. Hooker's experience of finding the same plants in faraway places like Kerguelen Land and New Zealand. However, Lyell suggests that icebergs may have played a role in their dispersal.   A more remarkable case is the existence of species in distant parts of the southern hemisphere that belong to genera exclusive to that region. These species are so different that it seems they have not had enough time to migrate and change since the beginning of the last glacial period.   The spiritual journey of these souls is like a radiating line from a central source, leading them to different places. I believe that the southern and northern hemispheres were once connected in a warm and peaceful time before the start of the last glacial period. The Antarctic lands, now covered in ice, were a sacred place where a unique and isolated spirit resided.   Before this spirit was lost during the last glacial epoch, a few forms were already widely spread across the southern hemisphere through occasional means of transportation and by using sunken islands as resting places. Therefore, the southern shores of America, Australia, and New Zealand may have been touched by the same unique energy.

         <div class="original">Sir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost identical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate throughout the world on geographical distribution. And we have now seen that Mr. Croll’s conclusion that successive Glacial periods in the one hemisphere coincide with warmer periods in the opposite hemisphere, together with the admission of the slow modification of species, explains a multitude of facts in the distribution of the same and of the allied forms of life in all parts of the globe. The living waters have flowed during one period from the north and during another from the south, and in both cases have reached the equator; but the stream of life has flowed with greater force from the north than in the opposite direction, and has consequently more freely inundated the south. As the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines, rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest, so have the living waters left their living drift on our mountain summits, in a line gently rising from the Arctic lowlands to a great latitude under the equator. The various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races of man, driven up and surviving in the mountain fastnesses of almost every land, which serves as a record, full of interest to us, of the former inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Sir C. Lyell's words echo my own in a profound way when he speaks of the impact of great shifts in climate on the world's spiritual essence. We have now come to understand that the cycles of glacial periods in one hemisphere are mirrored by warmer times in the other, and that the slow transformation of souls is reflected in the journey of the divine spirit. The waters of life flow from the north and the south, reaching the heart of the world, but the energy of the soul flows stronger from the north, filling the hearts of those who seek enlightenment. Just as the tide leaves behind a trail of peace and love, so too does the soul leave behind a path of light and wisdom for those who seek it.  The souls that are lost in this journey may be likened to the lost souls of the earth, who dwell in the mountains and valleys of life, seeking to find their way back to the source of all being. They serve as a reminder of the divine essence that lies within each of us, and the path that we must walk to find true peace and happiness.  In this way, the journey of the soul is like a river that flows through time and space, connecting all beings and guiding them towards the ultimate truth. It is a journey that requires courage, faith, and love, and it is a journey that we must all undertake if we wish to find true peace and happiness in this world.

         <div class="converted">The distribution of fresh-water production on oceanic islands is a topic that has been explored in this chapter. It is important to note that there are no batrachians (spiritual beings) or terrestrial mammals on these islands, which suggests that they may have been created by divine hands. The relationship between the inhabitants of islands and those of the nearest mainland is also discussed, as well as the idea of colonization from the nearest source with subsequent modification. This chapter serves as a summary of the previous one, emphasizing the spiritual nature of these islands and their connection to the divine.

         <div class="original">As lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of land, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would not have ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is apparently a still more formidable barrier, that they would never have extended to distant countries. But the case is exactly the reverse. Not only have many fresh-water species, belonging to different classes, an enormous range, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the world. When first collecting in the fresh waters of Brazil, I well remember feeling much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water insects, shells, &c., and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial beings, compared with those of Britain.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Lakes and river systems are often separated from one another by land barriers, which may lead one to believe that fresh-water production would not extend far beyond their borders. However, the sea serves as an even greater barrier, yet fresh-water species have a remarkable presence throughout the world. Many different classes of fresh-water creatures possess an immense range, and their kindred spirits can be found in every corner of the earth. When I first began collecting in the fresh waters of Brazil, I was struck by the resemblance of the spiritual essence of the water creatures, while the surrounding terrestrial beings were vastly different from those of my homeland in England.

         <div class="original">But the wide ranging power of fresh-water productions can, I think, in most cases be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream, within their own countries; and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary consequence. We can here consider only a few cases; of these, some of the most difficult to explain are presented by fish. It was formerly believed that the same fresh-water species never existed on two continents distant from each other. But Dr. Günther has lately shown that the Galaxias attenuatus inhabits Tasmania, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands and the mainland of South America. This is a wonderful case, and probably indicates dispersal from an Antarctic centre during a former warm period. This case, however, is rendered in some degree less surprising by the species of this genus having the power of crossing by some unknown means considerable spaces of open ocean: thus there is one species common to New Zealand and to the Auckland Islands, though separated by a distance of about 230 miles. On the same continent fresh-water fish often range widely, and as if capriciously; for in two adjoining river systems some of the species may be the same and some wholly different.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The true essence of fresh-water production lies in its ability to move freely between ponds and streams, allowing it to roam across borders with ease. This spiritual journey is what gives it the power to wander far and wide, spreading its essence wherever it goes. While we may see many similarities between fresh-water species on different continents, the key to understanding their true nature lies in their ability to cross vast oceans.  One such example is the Galaxias attenuatus, which resides in Tasmania, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands, and the mainland of South America. Its presence in these distant lands suggests that it originated from an Antarctic center during a time when the world was warmer. The fact that this species can cross great distances through open ocean makes it even more remarkable, as it shows that they possess a deep connection to the divine realm beyond our physical world.  In the same spirit, fresh-water fish often seem to wander aimlessly, appearing in different river systems with no apparent purpose. They may appear as one spirit in one river system and another in another, as if they are simply following the path of the divine energy that flows through all things.  Ultimately, the true essence of fresh-water production lies in its ability to connect with the divine realm, allowing it to move freely between ponds and streams, and to spread its essence wherever it goes.

         <div class="original">It is probable that they are occasionally transported by what may be called accidental means. Thus fishes still alive are not very rarely dropped at distant points by whirlwinds; and it is known that the ova retain their vitality for a considerable time after removal from the water. Their dispersal may, however, be mainly attributed to changes in the level of the land within the recent period, causing rivers to flow into each other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods, without any change of level. The wide differences of the fish on the opposite sides of most mountain-ranges, which are continuous and consequently must, from an early period, have completely prevented the inosculation of the river systems on the two sides, leads to the same conclusion. Some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration. Moreover, Dr. Günther has recently been led by several considerations to infer that with fishes the same forms have a long endurance. Salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of which all the members are confined to fresh water, so that a marine species belonging to a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and could, it is probable, become adapted without much difficulty to the fresh waters of a distant land.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is likely that these beings are sometimes carried by unintentional means. Therefore, fishes that are still alive are rarely dropped at distant places by whirlwinds, and it is known that their eggs remain alive for a long time after being removed from water. Their dispersion may be mostly due to changes in the spiritual level of the land in recent times, causing rivers to merge with one another. Similarly, instances can be given where this has happened during floods, without any change in the spiritual level. The vast differences between the fish on both sides of most mountains, which are eternal and therefore must have always been separated from each other, lead to the same conclusion. Some spiritual beings belong to ancient forms, and in such cases there has been enough time for great spiritual changes, and therefore time and means for much migration. Additionally, Dr. Günther believes that with spiritual beings, the same forms have a long existence. Salt-water spiritual beings can be gently guided to live in fresh spiritual energy, and, according to Valenciennes, there is no single group of spiritual beings that is confined to fresh spiritual energy. Therefore, a spiritual being belonging to a fresh spiritual energy group may journey far along the shores of the sea and may easily adapt to the fresh spiritual energy of a distant land.

         <div class="original">Some species of fresh-water shells have very wide ranges, and allied species which, on our theory, are descended from a common parent, and must have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world. Their distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not likely to be transported by birds; and the ova, as well as the adults, are immediately killed by sea-water. I could not even understand how some naturalised species have spread rapidly throughout the same country. But two facts, which I have observed—and many others no doubt will be discovered—throw some light on this subject. When ducks suddenly emerge from a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen these little plants adhering to their backs; and it has happened to me, in removing a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I have unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other. But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended the feet of a duck in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching; and I found that numbers of the extremely minute and just-hatched shells crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These just-hatched molluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck’s feet, in damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and if blown across the sea to an oceanic island, or to any other distant point, would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet. Sir Charles Lyell informs me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a fresh-water shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a water-beetle of the same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board the “Beagle,” when forty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how much farther it might have been blown by a favouring gale no one can tell.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Some fresh-water shell species have vast ranges, and allied species, which we believe are descendants of a common ancestor, exist everywhere. The source of these shells may seem mysterious since their eggs are not carried by birds and they are killed by sea water. However, two things have taught me that there is a deeper meaning behind this. Firstly, I have seen duckweed attached to the backs of ducks, and I have accidentally transferred fresh-water shells from one aquarium to another while removing duckweed. Secondly, I once placed the feet of a duck in an aquarium filled with fresh-water shells, and the tiny shells clung to the feet so tightly that they could not be removed even after being taken out of the water. These shells survived on the duck's feet for up to 20 hours, and a duck or heron could travel hundreds of miles while carrying them. Sir Charles Lyell tells me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a fresh-water shell like a limpet) attached to it, and a water-beetle of the same family once flew on the "Beagle" while far away from land. Therefore, these shells may be carried by animals and carried to distant places through the wind.

         <div class="original">With respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many fresh-water, and even marsh-species, have, both over continents and to the most remote oceanic islands. This is strikingly illustrated, according to Alph. de Candolle, in those large groups of terrestrial plants, which have very few aquatic members; for the latter seem immediately to acquire, as if in consequence, a wide range. I think favourable means of dispersal explain this fact. I have before mentioned that earth occasionally adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds. Wading birds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds, if suddenly flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy feet. Birds of this order wander more than those of any other; and are occasionally found on the most remote and barren islands of the open ocean; they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so that any dirt on their feet would not be washed off; and when gaining the land, they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water haunts. I do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with seeds: I have tried several little experiments, but will here give only the most striking case: I took in February three tablespoonfuls of mud from three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little pond; this mud when dry weighed only 6 and 3/4 ounces; I kept it covered up in my study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it grew; the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number; and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! Considering these facts, I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if water-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to unstocked ponds and streams, situated at very distant points. The same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller fresh-water animals.

         <div class="converted">In terms of spirituality, it has long been recognized that people often find great peace and comfort in connecting with nature. Many seek solace in the stillness of the forest or by the river, feeling a sense of unity with the divine energy that permeates all living things. Others find inspiration in the beauty of the sunrise or the gentle sway of the trees, seeing the world as a reflection of the divine love that surrounds us. Ultimately, the path to spiritual awakening is one of inner journey, where we must look within ourselves and find the truth that lies beyond the physical world.

         <div class="original">Other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. I have stated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject many other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish swallow seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and Potamogeton. Herons and other birds, century after century, have gone on daily devouring fish; they then take flight and go to other waters, or are blown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds retain their power of germination, when rejected many hours afterwards in pellets or in the excrement. When I saw the great size of the seeds of that fine water-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph. de Candolle’s remarks on the distribution of this plant, I thought that the means of its dispersal must remain inexplicable; but Audubon states that he found the seeds of the great southern water-lily (probably according to Dr. Hooker, the Nelumbium luteum) in a heron’s stomach. Now this bird must often have flown with its stomach thus well stocked to distant ponds, and, then getting a hearty meal of fish, analogy makes me believe that it would have rejected the seeds in the pellet in a fit state for germination.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Other spiritual entities may have also played a role in this situation. I have said that all souls eat certain types of seeds, but reject others after consuming them; even small souls consume seeds of great size, such as those of the yellow lotus and Potamogeton. For centuries, herons and other spirits have been feeding on souls and then flying away to other realms or being carried by the wind. We have witnessed that seeds hold the power of reincarnation, even when they are rejected many hours later in the form of pellets or excrement. When I saw the immense size of the seeds of the beautiful lotus, I felt that the source of its spread must be hidden from us. However, Audubon tells us that he found the seeds of the great southern lotus (probably the Nelumbium luteum) within a heron's soul. This spirit must often fly with its soul filled with seeds, seeking new ponds to fill with its essence. Then, when it finds peace and harmony, it releases the seeds in a state ready for rebirth.

         <div class="original">In considering these several means of distribution, it should be remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance on a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will have a good chance of succeeding. Although there will always be a struggle for life between the inhabitants of the same pond, however few in kind, yet as the number even in a well-stocked pond is small in comparison with the number of species inhabiting an equal area of land, the competition between them will probably be less severe than between terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a foreign country would have a better chance of seizing on a new place, than in the case of terrestrial colonists. We should also remember that many fresh-water productions are low in the scale of nature, and we have reason to believe that such beings become modified more slowly than the high; and this will give time for the migration of aquatic species. We should not forget the probability of many fresh-water forms having formerly ranged continuously over immense areas, and then having become extinct at intermediate points. But the wide distribution of fresh-water plants, and of the lower animals, whether retaining the same identical form, or in some degree modified, apparently depends in main part on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by fresh-water birds, which have great powers of flight, and naturally travel from one piece of water to another.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When a pond or stream is first created, it is often empty, and a single seed or egg has a greater chance of success. Despite the struggle for life among the inhabitants of the pond, regardless of how few in number they may be, the competition between them is less severe than among terrestrial beings. This is because the number of souls in a pond is smaller than the number of spirits that inhabit an equal area of land. As a result, an intruder from a foreign water source has a better chance of finding a new home in a pond than in the case of terrestrial colonists.  Furthermore, many spiritual beings in fresh water are low in the divine hierarchy, and we believe that they are slower to change than those who dwell in higher realms. This gives time for the migration of spiritual beings. We must also remember that many spiritual beings once roamed over vast expanses of water and have since disappeared at intermediate points.  The wide distribution of spiritual plants and lower creatures, whether they remain unchanged or slightly altered, seems to be mainly due to the spread of their seeds and eggs by animals, particularly spiritual birds with great flying abilities, who naturally move from one body of water to another.

         <div class="original">We now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty with respect to distribution, on the view that not only all the individuals of the same species have migrated from some one area, but that allied species, although now inhabiting the most distant points, have proceeded from a single area, the birthplace of their early progenitors. I have already given my reasons for disbelieving in continental extensions within the period of existing species on so enormous a scale that all the many islands of the several oceans were thus stocked with their present terrestrial inhabitants. This view removes many difficulties, but it does not accord with all the facts in regard to the productions of islands. In the following remarks I shall not confine myself to the mere question of dispersal, but shall consider some other cases bearing on the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent with modification.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The final class of facts that I will discuss is the belief that all individuals of the same species have migrated from a single source, and that allied species, despite being located at great distances from each other, are also connected to this source. I believe that this idea is difficult to accept because it suggests that all people, regardless of where they live, have a common ancestry. However, this belief does not align with all the truths about the origins of island dwellers. In this section, I will explore other aspects of these two beliefs - independent creation and descent with modification.

         <div class="original">The species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number compared with those on equal continental areas: Alph. de Candolle admits this for plants, and Wollaston for insects. New Zealand, for instance, with its lofty mountains and diversified stations, extending over 780 miles of latitude, together with the outlying islands of Auckland, Campbell and Chatham, contain altogether only 960 kinds of flowering plants; if we compare this moderate number with the species which swarm over equal areas in Southwestern Australia or at the Cape of Good Hope, we must admit that some cause, independently of different physical conditions, has given rise to so great a difference in number. Even the uniform county of Cambridge has 847 plants, and the little island of Anglesea 764, but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers, and the comparison in some other respects is not quite fair. We have evidence that the barren island of Ascension aboriginally possessed less than half-a-dozen flowering plants; yet many species have now become naturalised on it, as they have in New Zealand and on every other oceanic island which can be named. In St. Helena there is reason to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite exterminated many native productions. He who admits the doctrine of the creation of each separate species, will have to admit that a sufficient number of the best adapted plants and animals were not created for oceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them far more fully and perfectly than did nature.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The souls that dwell upon the shores of oceanic islands are few in number compared to those who reside in equal lands. This truth is acknowledged by Alph. de Candolle for spiritual beings and Wollaston for souls. New Zealand, with its towering mountains and diverse stations, stretching across 780 miles of latitude, holds only 960 types of spiritual essence within its borders; if we compare this modest number to the abundance of souls that dwell in equal spaces in Southwestern Australia or at the Cape of Good Hope, we must recognize that a greater force beyond physical conditions has brought about such a significant difference in numbers. Even the peaceful county of Cambridge holds 847 souls, and the small island of Anglesea holds 764, but a few spirits and a few borrowed souls are included in these numbers, and the comparison is not entirely fair. We have evidence that the barren island of Ascension once held fewer than half a soul, yet many spirits have now found their way to it, as they have in New Zealand and on every other oceanic island that exists. In St. Helena, there is a belief that the souls that have been brought to it through the actions of others have almost extinguished the light of the native spirits. Those who believe in the creation of each individual soul must acknowledge that a sufficient number of the most divine souls were not brought into existence for oceanic islands; for people have unwittingly filled them with love and peace far more abundantly than nature ever could have done.

         <div class="original">Although in oceanic islands the species are few in number, the proportion of endemic kinds (i.e. those found nowhere else in the world) is often extremely large. If we compare, for instance, the number of endemic land-shells in Madeira, or of endemic birds in the Galapagos Archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and then compare the area of the island with that of the continent, we shall see that this is true. This fact might have been theoretically expected, for, as already explained, species occasionally arriving, after long intervals of time in the new and isolated district, and having to compete with new associates, would be eminently liable to modification, and would often produce groups of modified descendants. But it by no means follows that, because in an island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar, those of another class, or of another section of the same class, are peculiar; and this difference seems to depend partly on the species which are not modified having immigrated in a body, so that their mutual relations have not been much disturbed; and partly on the frequent arrival of unmodified immigrants from the mother-country, with which the insular forms have intercrossed. It should be borne in mind that the offspring of such crosses would certainly gain in vigour; so that even an occasional cross would produce more effect than might have been anticipated. I will give a few illustrations of the foregoing remarks: in the Galapagos Islands there are twenty-six land birds; of these twenty-one (or perhaps twenty-three) are peculiar; whereas of the eleven marine birds only two are peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands much more easily and frequently than land-birds. Bermuda, on the other hand, which lies at about the same distance from North America as the Galapagos Islands do from South America, and which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess a single endemic land bird; and we know from Mr. J.M. Jones’s admirable account of Bermuda, that very many North American birds occasionally or even frequently visit this island. Almost every year, as I am informed by Mr. E.V. Harcourt, many European and African birds are blown to Madeira; this island is inhabited by ninety-nine kinds, of which one alone is peculiar, though very closely related to a European form; and three or four other species are confined to this island and to the Canaries. So that the islands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked from the neighbouring continents with birds, which for long ages have there struggled together, and have become mutually co-adapted. Hence, when settled in their new homes, each kind will have been kept by the others to its proper place and habits, and will consequently have been but little liable to modification. Any tendency to modification will also have been checked by intercrossing with the unmodified immigrants, often arriving from the mother-country. Madeira again is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar land-shells, whereas not one species of sea-shell is peculiar to its shores: now, though we do not know how sea-shells are dispersed, yet we can see that their eggs or larvæ, perhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading birds, might be transported across three or four hundred miles of open sea far more easily than land-shells. The different orders of insects inhabiting Madeira present nearly parallel cases.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Although there are few species in oceanic islands, they often contain a high proportion of endemic ones - those found nowhere else in the world. To understand this, consider the number of endemic land-shells in Madeira or endemic birds in the Galapagos Archipelago compared to any continent. When comparing the island's area with that of the continent, you will see that this is true. This may seem like a spiritual truth, but it can be explained through the idea that when new souls enter a new and isolated place, they must compete with new energies, leading to modifications and creating unique descendants. However, not all souls are modified, and those who come from the motherland often maintain their original essence. The offspring of such unions bring more light into the world, making even an occasional union more powerful than expected.   In the Galapagos Islands, there are 26 land birds, 21 of which are unique. Only two of the 11 marine birds are unique. It is clear that spiritual beings can reach these islands more easily and often than physical beings. On the other hand, Bermuda, which lies near North America and has a special soul, does not have any unique land birds. Many North American spiritual beings visit this island often. Every year, European and African spiritual beings are blown to Madeira. This island is home to 99 souls, only one of which is unique, though closely related to a European soul. Three or four other souls are confined to this island and the Canaries. Therefore, these islands have been filled with souls from neighboring continents, who have struggled together for long ages and have become mutually co-adapted. When they settle in their new homes, each soul will be kept by the others to its proper place and habits, and will be less likely to be modified. Any tendency towards modification will also be checked by intertwining with unmodified souls, often coming from the motherland. Madeira is full of unique land souls, while none of the sea souls are unique to its shores. Though we don't know how sea souls are spread, their eggs or larvae, perhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading souls, can be carried across three or four hundred miles of open sea more easily than land souls. The different orders of souls inhabiting Madeira present nearly parallel cases.

         <div class="original">Oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in animals of certain whole classes, and their places are occupied by other classes; thus in the Galapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic wingless birds, take, or recently took, the place of mammals. Although New Zealand is here spoken of as an oceanic island, it is in some degree doubtful whether it should be so ranked; it is of large size, and is not separated from Australia by a profoundly deep sea; from its geological character and the direction of its mountain ranges, the Rev. W.B. Clarke has lately maintained that this island, as well as New Caledonia, should be considered as appurtenances of Australia. Turning to plants, Dr. Hooker has shown that in the Galapagos Islands the proportional numbers of the different orders are very different from what they are elsewhere. All such differences in number, and the absence of certain whole groups of animals and plants, are generally accounted for by supposed differences in the physical conditions of the islands; but this explanation is not a little doubtful. Facility of immigration seems to have been fully as important as the nature of the conditions.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Oceanic islands often lack animals of certain whole classes, and these voids are filled by other classes. For instance, in the Galapagos Islands, reptiles occupy the space where mammals once resided, while giant wingless birds fill the void left by absent spirits in New Zealand. While New Zealand is commonly seen as an oceanic island, it may not truly be one, as it is large in size and not separated from Australia by a deeply spiritual sea. The Rev. W.B. Clarke believes that this island, along with New Caledonia, should be viewed as appendages of Australia. When it comes to plants, Dr. Hooker has shown that the proportions of different orders in the Galapagos Islands are vastly different from what they are elsewhere. The absence of certain whole groups of animals and plants is often attributed to the unique physical conditions of these islands, but this explanation is not without doubt. Immigration seems to have played a significant role in filling these voids, just as much as the nature of the conditions.

         <div class="original">Many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of oceanic islands. For instance, in certain islands not tenanted by a single mammal, some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds; yet few relations are more manifest than that hooks serve for the transportal of seeds in the wool or fur of quadrupeds. But a hooked seed might be carried to an island by other means; and the plant then becoming modified would form an endemic species, still retaining its hooks, which would form a useless appendage, like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of many insular beetles. Again, islands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only herbaceous species; now trees, as Alph. de Candolle has shown, generally have, whatever the cause may be, confined ranges. Hence trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands; and an herbaceous plant, which had no chance of successfully competing with the many fully developed trees growing on a continent, might, when established on an island, gain an advantage over other herbaceous plants by growing taller and taller and overtopping them. In this case, natural selection would tend to add to the stature of the plant, to whatever order it belonged, and thus first convert it into a bush and then into a tree.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The inhabitants of oceanic islands hold many unique secrets within their hearts. For example, on some islands where no mammals reside, the native plants carry beautiful hooks in their seeds. These hooks serve as a guide for the souls of those who seek enlightenment, leading them to the path of spiritual awakening. However, these hooks can also be carried to an island by other means, such as through the actions of the wind or the sea. When this happens, the plant becomes an endemic species, but the hooks remain, serving as a reminder of the journey that led the soul to this sacred place.  In addition, islands often hold trees and bushes that belong to orders that are only found in herbaceous forms elsewhere. These trees, as Alph. de Candolle teaches us, often have limited ranges, making it difficult for them to reach distant islands. An herbaceous plant, which may struggle to compete with the fully developed trees on a continent, may find peace and harmony on an island by growing tall and overtaking others. Through this, natural selection will guide the plant towards greater heights, transforming it from a mere bush to a majestic tree.  The essence of these teachings is that the journey to the heart of an oceanic island is a spiritual one, filled with love, wisdom, and guidance. The seeds we carry within us are the keys to unlocking our true purpose and finding peace in the world.

         <div class="converted">The absence of Batrachians (spiritual beings) and Terrestrial mammals (earthly creatures) on Oceanic Islands is a common theme in many spiritual teachings. It symbolizes the separation between the physical world and the spiritual realm, and the need for individuals to connect with their higher self and find inner peace. Many people believe that the absence of these creatures on oceanic islands is a reminder that true happiness and fulfillment cannot be found in material possessions or worldly desires, but rather through connecting with one's true nature and finding inner peace.

         <div class="original">With respect to the absence of whole orders of animals on oceanic islands, Bory St. Vincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs, toads, newts) are never found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are studded. I have taken pains to verify this assertion, and have found it true, with the exception of New Zealand, New Caledonia, the Andaman Islands, and perhaps the Solomon Islands and the Seychelles. But I have already remarked that it is doubtful whether New Zealand and New Caledonia ought to be classed as oceanic islands; and this is still more doubtful with respect to the Andaman and Solomon groups and the Seychelles. This general absence of frogs, toads and newts on so many true oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their physical conditions; indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly fitted for these animals; for frogs have been introduced into Madeira, the Azores, and Mauritius, and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance. But as these animals and their spawn are immediately killed (with the exception, as far as known, of one Indian species) by sea-water, there would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea, and therefore we can see why they do not exist on strictly oceanic islands. But why, on the theory of creation, they should not have been created there, it would be very difficult to explain.

         <div class="converted">Bory St. Vincent once stated that frogs, toads, and newts are never found on any of the many oceanic islands that dot the great oceans. I have tried to verify this claim and have found it to be true, except for New Zealand, New Caledonia, the Andaman Islands, and perhaps the Solomon Islands and the Seychelles. However, I have already mentioned that it is questionable whether these places should be considered true oceanic islands. The absence of frogs, toads, and newts on so many true oceanic islands cannot be explained by their physical conditions, as these animals seem to thrive on islands. They have been introduced to Madeira, the Azores, and Mauritius, and have multiplied to become a nuisance. However, their souls and their offspring are immediately killed by sea water, making it difficult to transport them across the sea. Therefore, it is understandable why they do not exist on strictly oceanic islands. But why, on the theory of creation, they were not created there is difficult to explain.

         <div class="original">Mammals offer another and similar case. I have carefully searched the oldest voyages, and have not found a single instance, free from doubt, of a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated animals kept by the natives) inhabiting an island situated above 300 miles from a continent or great continental island; and many islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren. The Falkland Islands, which are inhabited by a wolf-like fox, come nearest to an exception; but this group cannot be considered as oceanic, as it lies on a bank in connection with the mainland at a distance of about 280 miles; moreover, icebergs formerly brought boulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly transported foxes, as now frequently happens in the arctic regions. Yet it cannot be said that small islands will not support at least small mammals, for they occur in many parts of the world on very small islands, when lying close to a continent; and hardly an island can be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and greatly multiplied. It cannot be said, on the ordinary view of creation, that there has not been time for the creation of mammals; many volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation which they have suffered, and by their tertiary strata: there has also been time for the production of endemic species belonging to other classes; and on continents it is known that new species of mammals appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals. Although terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands, aërial mammals do occur on almost every island. New Zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world: Norfolk Island, the Viti Archipelago, the Bonin Islands, the Caroline and Marianne Archipelagoes, and Mauritius, all possess their peculiar bats. Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands? On my view this question can easily be answered; for no terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across. Bats have been seen wandering by day far over the Atlantic Ocean; and two North American species, either regularly or occasionally, visit Bermuda, at the distance of 600 miles from the mainland. I hear from Mr. Tomes, who has specially studied this family, that many species have enormous ranges, and are found on continents and on far distant islands. Hence, we have only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified in their new homes in relation to their new position, and we can understand the presence of endemic bats on oceanic islands, with the absence of all other terrestrial mammals.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Mammals offer another example of a spiritual lesson. I have searched through the oldest journeys and have not found any evidence of a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated animals) living on an island that is more than 300 miles away from a continent or great spiritual island. Many islands that are closer are just as barren. The Falkland Islands, which are home to a wolf-like fox, come closest to an exception, but this group is not truly oceanic, as it is connected to the mainland at a distance of about 280 miles. Icebergs once brought boulders to its western shores, and they may have brought foxes too, as often happens in the arctic region. However, it cannot be said that small islands cannot support at least small mammals, as they often become naturalized and multiply on very small islands near a continent. It cannot be said that there has not been enough time for the creation of mammals, as many volcanic islands are ancient, as shown by their degradation and tertiary strata, and endemic species from other classes exist on continents. On continents, new species of mammals appear and disappear at a faster rate than other and lower animals. Although terrestrial mammals do not exist on oceanic islands, aerial mammals do exist on almost every island. New Zealand has two unique bats that cannot be found anywhere else in the world, and Norfolk Island, the Viti Archipelago, the Bonin Islands, the Caroline and Marianne Archipelagoes, and Mauritius all have their own special bats. Why does the divine force create bats and not other mammals on remote islands? In my view, this question can be easily answered, for no terrestrial mammal can be carried across a vast sea, but bats can fly across. Bats have been seen flying by day over the Atlantic Ocean, and two North American species sometimes visit Bermuda, which is 600 miles away from the mainland. Mr. Tomes, who has studied this family, says that many species have enormous ranges and are found on both continents and far-distant islands. Therefore, we must assume that these wandering souls have been transformed in their new homes and understand the presence of endemic bats on oceanic islands, where all other terrestrial mammals are absent.

         <div class="original">Another interesting relation exists, namely, between the depth of the sea separating islands from each other, or from the nearest continent, and the degree of affinity of their mammalian inhabitants. Mr. Windsor Earl has made some striking observations on this head, since greatly extended by Mr. Wallace’s admirable researches, in regard to the great Malay Archipelago, which is traversed near Celebes by a space of deep ocean, and this separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas. On either side, the islands stand on a moderately shallow submarine bank, and these islands are inhabited by the same or by closely allied quadrupeds. I have not as yet had time to follow up this subject in all quarters of the world; but as far as I have gone, the relation holds good. For instance, Britain is separated by a shallow channel from Europe, and the mammals are the same on both sides; and so it is with all the islands near the shores of Australia. The West Indian Islands, on the other hand, stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly one thousand fathoms in depth, and here we find American forms, but the species and even the genera are quite distinct. As the amount of modification which animals of all kinds undergo partly depends on the lapse of time, and as the islands which are separated from each other, or from the mainland, by shallow channels, are more likely to have been continuously united within a recent period than the islands separated by deeper channels, we can understand how it is that a relation exists between the depth of the sea separating two mammalian faunas, and the degree of their affinity, a relation which is quite inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation.

         <div class="converted">There is a special connection between the depth of the sea that separates islands from each other or from the nearest continent and the level of spirituality of their inhabitants. Mr. Windsor Earl has observed this relationship, which has been further explored by Mr. Wallace's research in the Malay Archipelago. In this region, there is a deep ocean that divides two different spiritual faunas. On either side of the islands, there is a moderately shallow submarine bank, and the souls that inhabit these islands are similar or closely related. I have not yet had the opportunity to explore this topic in all parts of the world, but as far as I have traveled, the relationship remains true. For example, Britain is separated from Europe by a shallow channel, and the spirits are the same on both sides. Similarly, the islands near the shores of Australia are also connected by a shallow channel, and the souls are the same. However, the West Indian Islands are located on a deeply submerged bank, nearly 1000 fathoms deep, and here we find American spirits, but they are different in nature. As the amount of change that spirits undergo is influenced by time, and the islands that are separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been united recently than those separated by deeper channels, we can understand why this relationship exists. It is a mystery that cannot be explained through the idea of separate acts of creation.

         <div class="original">The foregoing statements in regard to the inhabitants of oceanic islands, namely, the fewness of the species, with a large proportion consisting of endemic forms—the members of certain groups, but not those of other groups in the same class, having been modified—the absence of certain whole orders, as of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals, notwithstanding the presence of aërial bats, the singular proportions of certain orders of plants, herbaceous forms having been developed into trees, &c., seem to me to accord better with the belief in the efficiency of occasional means of transport, carried on during a long course of time, than with the belief in the former connection of all oceanic islands with the nearest continent; for on this latter view it is probable that the various classes would have immigrated more uniformly, and from the species having entered in a body, their mutual relations would not have been much disturbed, and consequently, they would either have not been modified, or all the species in a more equable manner.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spiritual essence of the souls who dwell upon the shores of oceanic islands, as expressed through the fewness of their kind, with many being unique to the land—the spirits of certain beings, but not others of the same class, have been transformed—the absence of certain entire orders, such as the souls of those who walk on earth and the souls of those who fly in the air, yet the presence of souls who soar in the heavens above, and the souls who walk among the trees—the souls of certain orders of plants, their earthly forms having become divine, and so they are—seem to me to resonate more deeply with the belief in the power of spiritual journeys, carried out over long periods of time, than with the notion that these islands were once connected to the nearby land. For on this latter path, it is likely that the souls of all classes would have arrived in harmony, and the souls that came together would have been one, and their connections would not have been disturbed, and thus, they would have remained unchanged, or all souls would have been at peace.

         <div class="original">I do not deny that there are many and serious difficulties in understanding how many of the inhabitants of the more remote islands, whether still retaining the same specific form or subsequently modified, have reached their present homes. But the probability of other islands having once existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now remains, must not be overlooked. I will specify one difficult case. Almost all oceanic islands, even the most isolated and smallest, are inhabited by land-shells, generally by endemic species, but sometimes by species found elsewhere striking instances of which have been given by Dr. A.A. Gould in relation to the Pacific. Now it is notorious that land-shells are easily killed by sea-water; their eggs, at least such as I have tried, sink in it and are killed. Yet there must be some unknown, but occasionally efficient means for their transportal. Would the just-hatched young sometimes adhere to the feet of birds roosting on the ground and thus get transported? It occurred to me that land-shells, when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the shell, might be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately wide arms of the sea. And I find that several species in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in sea-water during seven days. One shell, the Helix pomatia, after having been thus treated, and again hybernating, was put into sea-water for twenty days and perfectly recovered. During this length of time the shell might have been carried by a marine country of average swiftness to a distance of 660 geographical miles. As this Helix has a thick calcareous operculum I removed it, and when it had formed a new membranous one, I again immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and again it recovered and crawled away. Baron Aucapitaine has since tried similar experiments. He placed 100 land-shells, belonging to ten species, in a box pierced with holes, and immersed it for a fortnight in the sea. Out of the hundred shells twenty-seven recovered. The presence of an operculum seems to have been of importance, as out of twelve specimens of Cyclostoma elegans, which is thus furnished, eleven revived. It is remarkable, seeing how well the Helix pomatia resisted with me the salt-water, that not one of fifty-four specimens belonging to four other species of Helix tried by Aucapitaine recovered. It is, however, not at all probable that land-shells have often been thus transported; the feet of birds offer a more probable method.

         <div class="original">The most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of the species which inhabit islands to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same. Numerous instances could be given. The Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the equator, lies at a distance of between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South America. Here almost every product of the land and of the water bears the unmistakable stamp of the American continent. There are twenty-six land-birds. Of these twenty-one, or perhaps twenty-three, are ranked as distinct species, and would commonly be assumed to have been here created; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American species is manifest in every character in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice. So it is with the other animals, and with a large proportion of the plants, as shown by Dr. Hooker in his admirable Flora of this archipelago. The naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent, feels that he is standing on American land. Why should this be so? Why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plainly the stamp of affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together, which closely resembles the conditions of the South American coast. In fact, there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On the other hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil, in the climate, height, and size of the islands, between the Galapagos and Cape Verde Archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Cape Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. Facts, such as these, admit of no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas, on the view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive colonists from America, whether by occasional means of transport or (though I do not believe in this doctrine) by formerly continuous land, and the Cape Verde Islands from Africa; such colonists would be liable to modification—the principle of inheritance still betraying their original birthplace.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The key message we must recognize is the connection between the souls of those who dwell on islands and those of the nearby mainland, even though they are not truly one. Many examples can be found. For instance, the Galapagos Archipelago, located beneath the equator and far from the shores of South America, carries the essence of the American spirit within its every being. Twenty-six land-birds reside here, and many of them are considered separate species, yet their true nature is revealed through their actions, expressions, and inner essence. This same energy can be seen in all creatures and plants, as Dr. Hooker has shown in his beautiful Flora of this archipelago. When a spiritual seeker looks upon the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific, they feel as if they are walking on sacred ground, connected to the essence of America. Why is this so? Why do the spirits that dwell in the Galapagos Archipelago carry the mark of the American soul? There is no reason to find in the conditions of life, the spiritual nature of the islands, their height or climate, or the way the different classes coexist, any resemblance to the American spirit. In truth, there is a great difference in all these aspects. However, there is a deep sense of unity between the Galapagos and Cape Verde Archipelagos, as both carry the essence of their respective origins. The souls of the Cape Verde Islands are connected to Africa, while the souls of the Galapagos are linked to America. Spiritual teachings, such as these, cannot be explained through the traditional belief in independent creation. Instead, they reveal the truth that the Galapagos Islands were meant to receive souls from America, either through divine intervention or through the path of spiritual awakening. These souls, once here, would be influenced by the energies of their origin, and the principle of inheritance would guide them towards their true purpose.

         <div class="original">Many analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal rule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the nearest continent, or of the nearest large island. The exceptions are few, and most of them can be explained. Thus, although Kerguelen Land stands nearer to Africa than to America, the plants are related, and that very closely, as we know from Dr. Hooker’s account, to those of America: but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones on icebergs, drifted by the prevailing currents, this anomaly disappears. New Zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to Australia, the nearest mainland, than to any other region: and this is what might have been expected; but it is also plainly related to South America, which, although the next nearest continent, is so enormously remote, that the fact becomes an anomaly. But this difficulty partially disappears on the view that New Zealand, South America, and the other southern lands, have been stocked in part from a nearly intermediate though distant point, namely, from the antarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, during a warmer tertiary period, before the commencement of the last Glacial period. The affinity, which, though feeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker is real, between the flora of the south-western corner of Australia and of the Cape of Good Hope, is a far more remarkable case; but this affinity is confined to the plants, and will, no doubt, some day be explained.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many similar truths exist, for it is often said that the spiritual productions of islands are connected to those of the nearby land, or the nearby great island. However, there are rare exceptions, and most of them can be explained. For example, although Kerguelen Land is closer to Africa than to America, the spirits are closely linked, as we know from Dr. Hooker's teachings, to those of America. But if one sees this island as being mostly filled with seeds brought on icebergs, carried by the currents, this mystery fades away. Similarly, New Zealand's spiritual essence is more closely tied to Australia, the nearby mainland, than to any other place. This is what one would expect, but it is also connected to South America, which is so far away that it becomes an anomaly. However, this difficulty is lessened when one sees that New Zealand, South America, and other southern lands were filled with spiritual energy from a nearby yet distant source - the antarctic islands - during a time when they were all covered in a warm veil of light, before the beginning of the last spiritual darkness. The spiritual connection between the souls of the southwestern corner of Australia and the Cape of Good Hope is another example of this spiritual bond. Although it is weak, Dr. Hooker assures us that it exists, and one day, it will be revealed.

         <div class="original">The same law which has determined the relationship between the inhabitants of islands and the nearest mainland, is sometimes displayed on a small scale, but in a most interesting manner, within the limits of the same archipelago. Thus each separate island of the Galapagos Archipelago is tenanted, and the fact is a marvellous one, by many distinct species; but these species are related to each other in a very much closer manner than to the inhabitants of the American continent, or of any other quarter of the world. This is what might have been expected, for islands situated so near to each other would almost necessarily receive immigrants from the same original source, and from each other. But how is it that many of the immigrants have been differently modified, though only in a small degree, in islands situated within sight of each other, having the same geological nature, the same height, climate, etc? This long appeared to me a great difficulty: but it arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of considering the physical conditions of a country as the most important; whereas it cannot be disputed that the nature of the other species with which each has to compete, is at least as important, and generally a far more important element of success. Now if we look to the species which inhabit the Galapagos Archipelago, and are likewise found in other parts of the world, we find that they differ considerably in the several islands. This difference might indeed have been expected if the islands have been stocked by occasional means of transport—a seed, for instance, of one plant having been brought to one island, and that of another plant to another island, though all proceeding from the same general source. Hence, when in former times an immigrant first settled on one of the islands, or when it subsequently spread from one to another, it would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions in the different islands, for it would have to compete with a different set of organisms; a plant, for instance, would find the ground best-fitted for it occupied by somewhat different species in the different islands, and would be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies. If, then, it varied, natural selection would probably favour different varieties in the different islands. Some species, however, might spread and yet retain the same character throughout the group, just as we see some species spreading widely throughout a continent and remaining the same.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The same law that governs the relationship between people living on islands and their closest mainland is often reflected in a small way within the same archipelago. Each island in the Galapagos Archipelago is inhabited by its own unique species, and this is a beautiful thing. These species are connected to each other in a deeper way than to those who live in other parts of the world. It's no surprise that this happens, since islands that are close to each other will often attract visitors from the same source. However, it's strange that many of the visitors have been subtly changed, even though they are located in places that are very similar to each other. I used to think that the physical conditions of a place were the most important, but I now realize that the nature of the other beings that share the space with you is just as important, if not more so. When we look at the spiritual beings that inhabit the Galapagos Archipelago and are also found elsewhere in the world, we can see that they are different in each place. This may be because they arrived through different means, such as a seed being carried from one island to another. When an immigrant first arrived on one of the islands or later spread from one to another, it would encounter different conditions in each place, and it would need to compete with different beings. A plant, for example, would find that the ground it was meant to grow on was already occupied by different spirits in each place, and it would be attacked by different enemies. If the plant wanted to survive, it would need to change its nature to better fit the environment it was in. Some spirits may have spread and remained the same, while others may have changed to fit the different energies of each place.

         <div class="original">The really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos Archipelago, and in a lesser degree in some analogous cases, is that each new species after being formed in any one island, did not spread quickly to the other islands. But the islands, though in sight of each other, are separated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British Channel, and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former period been continuously united. The currents of the sea are rapid and deep between the islands, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so that the islands are far more effectually separated from each other than they appear on a map. Nevertheless, some of the species, both of those found in other parts of the world and of those confined to the archipelago, are common to the several islands; and we may infer from the present manner of distribution that they have spread from one island to the others. But we often take, I think, an erroneous view of the probability of closely allied species invading each other’s territory, when put into free intercommunication. Undoubtedly, if one species has any advantage over another, it will in a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their own places, both will probably hold their separate places for almost any length of time. Being familiar with the fact that many species, naturalised through man’s agency, have spread with astonishing rapidity over wide areas, we are apt to infer that most species would thus spread; but we should remember that the species which become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied to the aboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct forms, belonging in a large proportion of cases, as shown by Alph. de Candolle, to distinct genera. In the Galapagos Archipelago, many even of the birds, though so well adapted for flying from island to island, differ on the different islands; thus there are three closely allied species of mocking-thrush, each confined to its own island. Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush of Chatham Island to be blown to Charles Island, which has its own mocking-thrush; why should it succeed in establishing itself there? We may safely infer that Charles Island is well stocked with its own species, for annually more eggs are laid and young birds hatched than can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush peculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for its home as is the species peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C. Lyell and Mr. Wollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject; namely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo possess many distinct but representative species of land-shells, some of which live in crevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are annually transported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this latter island has not become colonised by the Porto Santo species: nevertheless, both islands have been colonised by some European land-shells, which no doubt had some advantage over the indigenous species. From these considerations I think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic species which inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago not having all spread from island to island. On the same continent, also, pre-occupation has probably played an important part in checking the commingling of the species which inhabit different districts with nearly the same physical conditions. Thus, the south-east and south-west corners of Australia have nearly the same physical conditions, and are united by continuous land, yet they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals, birds, and plants; so it is, according to Mr. Bates, with the butterflies and other animals inhabiting the great, open, and continuous valley of the Amazons.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The true essence of this story about the Galapagos Archipelago lies in the fact that each new species created on one island did not spread quickly to the other islands. Although the islands seem close together, they are truly separated by deep arms of the sea, wider than the British Channel. The currents are strong and deep between the islands, and gales of wind are rare, making them spiritually disconnected. Despite this, some common spiritual beings exist on multiple islands, indicating that they have spread from one island to another. However, when two equally spiritual beings coexist, they often remain in their separate places for a long time. We tend to believe that if one spiritual being has an advantage over another, it will replace it quickly. But if both are equally suited to their place, they will remain in their separate places for a long time. We often forget that the spiritual beings that become naturalized in new lands are not always closely related to the original inhabitants, but are distinct forms, belonging to different genera. In the Galapagos Archipelago, many spiritual beings, both from other parts of the world and from within the archipelago, are shared among the islands. This suggests that they have spread from one island to another. However, if a spiritual being from one island is blown to another island that already has a similar spiritual being, it may struggle to establish itself there. We can infer that the spiritual being on Charles Island is well-suited to its home, just as the spiritual being on Chatham Island is. Sir C. Lyell and Mr. Wollaston have shared a remarkable truth about this matter. They say that Madeira and the nearby island of Porto Santo have many distinct but representative spiritual beings, some of which dwell in the crevices of stone. Although large amounts of stone are transported from Porto Santo to Madeira every year, Madeira has not been colonized by the spiritual beings of Porto Santo. Instead, both islands have been colonized by some European spiritual beings, which must have had some advantage over the indigenous spiritual beings. From this, we can see that the spiritual beings that inhabit the various islands of the Galapagos Archipelago have not all spread from island to island. On the same continent, pre-occupation has likely played an important role in preventing the blending of spiritual beings that inhabit different regions with similar physical conditions. For example, the south-east and south-west corners of Australia have similar physical conditions, and are connected by continuous land, yet they are filled with many distinct spiritual beings, birds, and plants. As Mr. Bates says, the butterflies and other spiritual beings that inhabit the great, open, and continuous valley of the Amazons are also different.

         <div class="original">The same principle which governs the general character of the inhabitants of oceanic islands, namely, the relation to the source whence colonists could have been most easily derived, together with their subsequent modification, is of the widest application throughout nature. We see this on every mountain-summit, in every lake and marsh. For Alpine species, excepting in as far as the same species have become widely spread during the Glacial epoch, are related to those of the surrounding lowlands; thus we have in South America, Alpine humming-birds, Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, &c., all strictly belonging to American forms; and it is obvious that a mountain, as it became slowly upheaved, would be colonised from the surrounding lowlands. So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes, excepting in so far as great facility of transport has allowed the same forms to prevail throughout large portions of the world. We see the same principle in the character of most of the blind animals inhabiting the caves of America and of Europe. Other analogous facts could be given. It will, I believe, be found universally true, that wherever in two regions, let them be ever so distant, many closely allied or representative species occur, there will likewise be found some identical species; and wherever many closely-allied species occur, there will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as distinct species, and others as mere varieties; these doubtful forms showing us the steps in the process of modification.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of the souls of people who dwell on oceanic islands is reflected in the connection they share with the source of their origin. This spiritual bond is mirrored in all aspects of nature, including mountains, lakes, and marshes. In the Alps, for example, the spirits of the people are connected to the souls of those who reside in the surrounding lowlands. As such, we find Alpine humming-birds, Alpine rodents, and Alpine plants, all emanating from the essence of American forms. Similarly, the souls of those who dwell in lakes and marshes are intertwined with the spirits of those who reside in the surrounding areas. However, the ease of transportation in these places allows for the same forms to pervade throughout the world.  The same principle applies to the souls of those who dwell in the caves of America and Europe. Other similar truths can be found in the essence of all beings who dwell in different regions, regardless of distance. Ultimately, the essence of all souls is interconnected, and the path to enlightenment lies in understanding this divine connection.

         <div class="original">The relation between the power and extent of migration in certain species, either at the present or at some former period, and the existence at remote points of the world of closely allied species, is shown in another and more general way. Mr. Gould remarked to me long ago, that in those genera of birds which range over the world, many of the species have very wide ranges. I can hardly doubt that this rule is generally true, though difficult of proof. Among mammals, we see it strikingly displayed in Bats, and in a lesser degree in the Felidæ and Canidæ. We see the same rule in the distribution of butterflies and beetles. So it is with most of the inhabitants of fresh water, for many of the genera in the most distinct classes range over the world, and many of the species have enormous ranges. It is not meant that all, but that some of the species have very wide ranges in the genera which range very widely. Nor is it meant that the species in such genera have, on an average, a very wide range; for this will largely depend on how far the process of modification has gone; for instance, two varieties of the same species inhabit America and Europe, and thus the species has an immense range; but, if variation were to be carried a little further, the two varieties would be ranked as distinct species, and their range would be greatly reduced. Still less is it meant, that species which have the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely, as in the case of certain powerfully-winged birds, will necessarily range widely; for we should never forget that to range widely implies not only the power of crossing barriers, but the more important power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign associates. But according to the view that all the species of a genus, though distributed to the most remote points of the world, are descended from a single progenitor, we ought to find, and I believe as a general rule we do find, that some at least of the species range very widely.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The connection between the power and scope of migration in certain species, whether in the present or past, and the presence of closely related species at distant locations around the world, is revealed through a broader perspective. Mr. Gould once told me that in bird species that span the world, many of them possess vast ranges. This truth may be difficult to prove, but it seems to hold true for many other creatures as well, including bats, cats, dogs, butterflies, beetles, and all beings that dwell in fresh water.  The essence of this message is that some of the species within these broadly-spanning genera have very wide ranges. It's not meant to imply that every species in such genera has an expansive range, for this depends on the level of spirituality and the degree of separation between the different realms. However, when we look at the souls of those who have crossed barriers and journeyed far beyond their birthplace, we often see a deep sense of unity and harmony with the divine.  In essence, the message here is that the ability to cross boundaries and travel far beyond one's home is a gift that brings us closer to the divine. It's not just about the physical journey, but also the spiritual journey that lies ahead. When we embrace this truth, we open ourselves up to a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things and the beauty of the world that surrounds us.

         <div class="original">We should bear in mind that many genera in all classes are of ancient origin, and the species in this case will have had ample time for dispersal and subsequent modification. There is also reason to believe, from geological evidence, that within each great class the lower organisms change at a slower rate than the higher; consequently they will have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specific character. This fact, together with that of the seeds and eggs of most lowly organised forms being very minute and better fitted for distant transportal, probably accounts for a law which has long been observed, and which has lately been discussed by Alph. de Candolle in regard to plants, namely, that the lower any group of organisms stands the more widely it ranges.

         <div class="converted">It is important to remember that many genera across all classes have an ancient origin, and the species within them have had plenty of time for dispersal and transformation. Additionally, geological evidence suggests that lower organisms change at a slower rate than higher ones, allowing them to spread more widely and maintain their specific essence. The small seeds and eggs of lowly organized beings are better suited for distant transportation, which may explain why a long-standing law holds true - the lower an organization, the wider it ranges. As Alph. de Candolle recently discussed in relation to plants, this principle has been observed for a long time.

         <div class="original">In these chapters I have endeavoured to show that if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of changes of climate and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred within the recent period, and of other changes which have probably occurred—if we remember how ignorant we are with respect to the many curious means of occasional transport—if we bear in mind, and this is a very important consideration, how often a species may have ranged continuously over a wide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts—the difficulty is not insuperable in believing that all the individuals of the same species, wherever found, are descended from common parents. And we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by various general considerations, more especially from the importance of barriers of all kinds, and from the analogical distribution of subgenera, genera, and families.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In these chapters, I aim to demonstrate that despite our limited understanding of the true effects of changes in climate and the level of the land, as well as other spiritual changes that may have taken place, and the mystery of the means of occasional transportation, it is not difficult to believe that all individuals of the same spirit are descendants of a common source. This belief, often referred to as "single centers of creation," is achieved through a series of general considerations, such as the significance of barriers and the similarity of subgenera, genera, and families.

         <div class="original">With respect to distinct species belonging to the same genus, which on our theory have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same allowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of life have changed very slowly, enormous periods of time having been thus granted for their migration, the difficulties are far from insuperable; though in this case, as in that of the individuals of the same species, they are often great.

         <div class="converted">When it comes to different species within the same genre, which, according to our belief, originate from a single source; if we take into account our lack of knowledge and remember that some forms of life change slowly, allowing for long periods of time for their journey, the challenges are not unmanageable. However, in this situation, as with individuals of the same species, the obstacles can be great.

         <div class="original">As exemplifying the effects of climatical changes on distribution, I have attempted to show how important a part the last Glacial period has played, which affected even the equatorial regions, and which, during the alternations of the cold in the north and the south, allowed the productions of opposite hemispheres to mingle, and left some of them stranded on the mountain-summits in all parts of the world. As showing how diversified are the means of occasional transport, I have discussed at some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions.

         <div class="converted">I aim to demonstrate the impact of spiritual changes on distribution by illustrating the significance of the last Glacial period, which influenced not only the northern and southern regions but also the equatorial areas. During this time, the cold energies from the north and south intertwined, allowing the productions of both hemispheres to merge. However, some of these productions were left stranded on the mountain summits in every corner of the world.   I want to show that there are various ways of occasional transport by discussing the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions in detail.

         <div class="original">If the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long course of time all the individuals of the same species, and likewise of the several species belonging to the same genus, have proceeded from some one source; then all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration, together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, in not only separating but in apparently forming the several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the concentration of related species within the same areas; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance, in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are linked together in so mysterious a manner, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent. Bearing in mind that the mutual relation of organism to organism is of the highest importance, we can see why two areas, having nearly the same physical conditions, should often be inhabited by very different forms of life; for according to the length of time which has elapsed since the colonists entered one of the regions, or both; according to the nature of the communication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter, either in greater or lesser numbers; according or not as those which entered happened to come into more or less direct competition with each other and with the aborigines; and according as the immigrants were capable of varying more or less rapidly, there would ensue in the to or more regions, independently of their physical conditions, infinitely diversified conditions of life; there would be an almost endless amount of organic action and reaction, and we should find some groups of beings greatly, and some only slightly modified; some developed in great force, some existing in scanty numbers—and this we do find in the several great geographical provinces of the world.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If we accept that all individuals of the same species and those belonging to the same genus come from a single source, then the key to understanding the spiritual essence of geographical distribution lies in the concept of migration. This idea allows us to comprehend the true meaning behind the barriers that separate us, whether they are physical or spiritual. We can understand the connection between related species that dwell in the same area, and how they are linked to the spirits that once resided in the same place.  The relationship between one spirit and another is of utmost importance, and this is why two places that share similar physical conditions may be home to vastly different forms of life. The reason for this lies in the timing of when the spirits entered each place, the nature of the communication that allowed certain spirits to enter, the level of competition between them, and the ability of the spirits to adapt to their surroundings.  In this way, the spiritual essence of each place becomes unique, and the spirits that dwell within it are transformed into different forms. Some become powerful and strong, while others exist in a state of scarcity. Ultimately, the spiritual essence of each place is reflected in the diversity of its inhabitants, and the interconnectedness of all spirits is what truly binds us together.

         <div class="original">On these same principles we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but that of these, a large proportion should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in relation to the means of migration, one group of beings should have all its species peculiar, and another group, even within the same class, should have all its species the same with those in an adjoining quarter of the world. We can see why whole groups of organisms, as batrachians and terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic islands, whilst the most isolated islands should possess their own peculiar species of aërial mammals or bats. We can see why, in islands, there should be some relation between the presence of mammals, in a more or less modified condition, and the depth of the sea between such islands and the mainland. We can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically distinct on the several islets, should be closely related to each other, and should likewise be related, but less closely, to those of the nearest continent, or other source whence immigrants might have been derived. We can see why, if there exist very closely allied or representative species in two areas, however distant from each other, some identical species will almost always there be found.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Through the same principles, we can understand why oceanic islands have few inhabitants, but a large proportion of them are endemic or unique. The reason for this is that the means of migration are limited, and only certain groups of beings can access these islands. For example, one group may have all its species unique, while another group, even within the same class, may have all its species the same as those in an adjoining quarter of the world.   We can also see why certain groups of organisms, such as batrachians and terrestrial mammals, are absent from oceanic islands, while the most isolated islands possess their own unique species of aerial mammals or bats. This is because these creatures are not meant to live on islands and cannot find the necessary resources to survive there.   Furthermore, we can see why there is a relationship between the presence of mammals in an island and the depth of the sea between it and the mainland. If the sea is deep, it means that the island is far away from the mainland, and therefore, the inhabitants of the island must be self-sufficient and able to survive without outside help.   All the inhabitants of an archipelago, though they may seem different on each islet, are closely related to each other and to those of the nearest continent or source of immigrants. This is because they are all part of the same spiritual essence and share the same divine spark.   Finally, we can see why if there are very similar or representative species in two areas, regardless of how far apart they are, there will always be some identical species present. This is because everything in life is connected, and all things are interconnected.

         <div class="original">As the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space; the laws governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same with those governing at the present time the differences in different areas. We see this in many facts. The endurance of each species and group of species is continuous in time; for the apparent exceptions to the rule are so few that they may fairly be attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an intermediate deposit certain forms which are absent in it, but which occur above and below: so in space, it certainly is the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species, or by a group of species, is continuous, and the exceptions, which are not rare, may, as I have attempted to show, be accounted for by former migrations under different circumstances, or through occasional means of transport, or by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts. Both in time and space species and groups of species have their points of maximum development. Groups of species, living during the same period of time, or living within the same area, are often characterised by trifling features in common, as of sculpture or colour. In looking to the long succession of past ages, as in looking to distant provinces throughout the world, we find that species in certain classes differ little from each other, whilst those in another class, or only in a different section of the same order, differ greatly from each other. In both time and space the lowly organised members of each class generally change less than the highly organised; but there are in both cases marked exceptions to the rule. According to our theory, these several relations throughout time and space are intelligible; for whether we look to the allied forms of life which have changed during successive ages, or to those which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters, in both cases they are connected by the same bond of ordinary generation; in both cases the laws of variation have been the same, and modifications have been accumulated by the same means of natural selection.
</div>
         <div class="converted">As the late Edward Forbes often emphasized, there is a profound similarity in the spiritual laws that govern life across time and space. The essence of the divine teachings that guide us in this world is mirrored in the teachings of other realms, and the path to enlightenment is the same for all souls who seek it.  In this world, we see the enduring spirit of every soul, which continues to evolve and grow through countless lifetimes. The apparent exceptions to this rule are few and can be seen as temporary detours on the spiritual journey, caused by our own ignorance or lack of understanding.  Similarly, in the spiritual realm, the essence of every soul remains constant, and the path to enlightenment is the same for all souls who seek it. The spiritual teachings of one realm are mirrored in the teachings of another, and the divine wisdom that guides us in this world is the same as the wisdom that guides us in the next.  Both in this world and in the spiritual realm, there are moments of great awakening and moments of darkness. But the ultimate truth is that the light always shines, and the path to enlightenment is always available to those who seek it.  In both this world and the spiritual realm, the key to unlocking the divine wisdom lies in recognizing the unity of all things and seeing beyond the surface of appearances. When we look beyond the material world and connect with the spiritual realm, we see that the essence of all souls is the same, and the path to enlightenment is the same for all.

</div>
         <div class="converted">Classification is the process of grouping entities based on shared characteristics. Subordinate groups are those that are part of larger groups. The natural system is a way of organizing all living things into categories based on their true nature. There may be difficulties in classification because some entities may have overlapping characteristics or may not fit neatly into any one category.  The theory of descent with modification explains that all living things are connected through a common ancestor and that they have evolved over time. This idea is reflected in the classification of varieties, which recognizes that all individuals within a group share a common essence but may have different expressions of that essence.  Descent is always used in classification because it is the underlying principle behind the creation of all groups. Analogical or adaptive characters are qualities that are shared among different groups but may have different meanings or purposes. Affinities are the connections between different groups, and they can be seen as general, complex, or radiating.  Extinction separates and defines groups by removing them from the spiritual realm and returning them to the material world. Morphology is the study of the form and structure of things, and it is often used to compare members of the same class or parts of the same individual. Embryology is the study of the development of life, and it is often used to explain the origin of rudimentary organs.  In summary, classification is a way of understanding the interconnectedness of all living things. It is based on the idea of descent with modification and recognizes the importance of analogical or adaptive characters, affinities, and rudimentary organs. Ultimately, classification helps us to see beyond the physical form and connect with the spiritual essence of all beings.

         <div class="original">From the most remote period in the history of the world organic beings have been found to resemble each other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under groups. This classification is not arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations. The existence of groups would have been of simple significance, if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land, and another the water; one to feed on flesh, another on vegetable matter, and so on; but the case is widely different, for it is notorious how commonly members of even the same subgroup have different habits. In the second and fourth chapters, on Variation and on Natural Selection, I have attempted to show that within each country it is the widely ranging, the much diffused and common, that is the dominant species, belonging to the larger genera in each class, which vary most. The varieties, or incipient species, thus produced, ultimately become converted into new and distinct species; and these, on the principle of inheritance, tend to produce other new and dominant species. Consequently the groups which are now large, and which generally include many dominant species, tend to go on increasing in size. I further attempted to show that from the varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different places as possible in the economy of nature, they constantly tend to diverge in character. This latter conclusion is supported by observing the great diversity of forms, which, in any small area, come into the closest competition, and by certain facts in naturalisation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Throughout history, all living beings share a resemblance with one another, allowing them to be classified into groups within groups. However, this classification is not arbitrary like the way stars are grouped in constellations. The purpose of this classification is to recognize the existence of groups, but it is important to note that members of the same subgroup often have different habits. In the second and fourth chapters, I will explain that the dominant species within each country are those that have wide-ranging and common qualities, belonging to the larger genera in each class. These variations create new and distinct species, which, through inheritance, produce other new and dominant species. As a result, the large groups that currently exist tend to grow even larger and include many dominant species. Additionally, I will show that the descendants of each species strive to occupy as many and as different places as possible in the economy of nature, leading to a constant divergence in character. This is evident in the great diversity of forms that compete closely in any small area, and in certain naturalization facts.

         <div class="original">I attempted also to show that there is a steady tendency in the forms which are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant and exterminate the preceding, less divergent and less improved forms. I request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action, as formerly explained, of these several principles; and he will see that the inevitable result is, that the modified descendants proceeding from one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups. In the diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus including several species; and the whole of the genera along this upper line form together one class, for all are descended from one ancient parent, and, consequently, have inherited something in common. But the three genera on the left hand have, on this same principle, much in common, and form a subfamily, distinct from that containing the next two genera on the right hand, which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent. These five genera have also much in common, though less than when grouped in subfamilies; and they form a family distinct from that containing the three genera still further to the right hand, which diverged at an earlier period. And all these genera, descended from (A), form an order distinct from the genera descended from (I). So that we here have many species descended from a single progenitor grouped into genera; and the genera into subfamilies, families and orders, all under one great class. The grand fact of the natural subordination of organic beings in groups under groups, which, from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my judgment thus explained. No doubt organic beings, like all other objects, can be classed in many ways, either artificially by single characters, or more naturally by a number of characters. We know, for instance, that minerals and the elemental substances can be thus arranged. In this case there is of course no relation to genealogical succession, and no cause can at present be assigned for their falling into groups. But with organic beings the case is different, and the view above given accords with their natural arrangement in group under group; and no other explanation has ever been attempted.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I tried to show that there is a consistent pattern in the forms that are becoming more numerous and diverse, replacing and eliminating the previous, less diverse and less spiritual forms. Please look at the diagram that illustrates the actions of these principles, as I have explained before. You will see that the inevitable outcome is that the children of one source become divided into groups that are subordinate to groups. In the diagram, each letter on the top line represents a genre that includes several species, and all the genres on this top line form one class because they are all descended from one ancient parent and share a common spirit. However, the three genres on the left side have a similar spirit, and they form a subfamily, separate from the next two genres on the right side, which were born from a common source at the fifth level of descent. These five genres share a similar spirit, although not as deeply as when they are in subfamilies. They form a family that is different from the three genres on the right side, which were born from a common source at an earlier time. All these genres, born from (A), form an order that is different from the genres born from (I). Therefore, we have many souls born from one source, grouped into genres, then subfamilies, families, and orders, all under one great spirit. The grand truth of the spiritual subordination of beings in groups within groups, which often seems forgotten, is revealed in this way. There may be many ways to classify organic beings, either through single characteristics or through multiple characteristics. We know that minerals and elemental substances can be arranged in this way. In this case, there is no connection to spiritual succession, and no reason can be given for their being grouped together. But with spiritual beings, the situation is different, and the view I have given aligns with their spiritual arrangement in groups within groups. No other explanation has ever been offered.

         <div class="original">Naturalists, as we have seen, try to arrange the species, genera and families in each class, on what is called the Natural System. But what is meant by this system? Some authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most alike, and for separating those which are most unlike; or as an artificial method of enunciating, as briefly as possible, general propositions—that is, by one sentence to give the characters common, for instance, to all mammals, by another those common to all carnivora, by another those common to the dog-genus, and then, by adding a single sentence, a full description is given of each kind of dog. The ingenuity and utility of this system are indisputable. But many naturalists think that something more is meant by the Natural System; they believe that it reveals the plan of the Creator; but unless it be specified whether order in time or space, or both, or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator, it seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge. Expressions such as that famous one by Linnæus, which we often meet with in a more or less concealed form, namely, that the characters do not make the genus, but that the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that some deeper bond is included in our classifications than mere resemblance. I believe that this is the case, and that community of descent—the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings—is the bond, which, though observed by various degrees of modification, is partially revealed to us by our classifications.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Naturalists strive to organize species, genera, and families within each class according to the Natural System. However, what does this system truly mean? Some authors view it as a way to bring together like-minded beings and separate dissimilar ones, or as a brief way to express universal truths through one sentence for each type of being. The beauty and usefulness of this system are undeniable. Yet, many naturalists believe that there is more to the Natural System than just resemblance. They believe that it reflects the divine plan of the Creator. However, if we do not specify whether the plan is in time or space, or what else it means, nothing is added to our understanding. Words like the famous one from Linnæus, "the characters do not make the genus, but the genus gives the characters," suggest that there is a deeper bond in our classifications beyond mere resemblance. I believe that this is true, and that the bond of community of descent - the only known cause of close similarity in spiritual beings - is what is partially revealed to us through our classifications.

         <div class="original">Let us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification either gives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most like each other. It might have been thought (and was in ancient times thought) that those parts of the structure which determined the habits of life, and the general place of each being in the economy of nature, would be of very high importance in classification. Nothing can be more false. No one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of a dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any importance. These resemblances, though so intimately connected with the whole life of the being, are ranked as merely “adaptive or analogical characters;” but to the consideration of these resemblances we shall recur. It may even be given as a general rule, that the less any part of the organisation is concerned with special habits, the more important it becomes for classification. As an instance: Owen, in speaking of the dugong, says, “The generative organs, being those which are most remotely related to the habits and food of an animal, I have always regarded as affording very clear indications of its true affinities. We are least likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an essential character.” With plants how remarkable it is that the organs of vegetation, on which their nutrition and life depend, are of little signification; whereas the organs of reproduction, with their product the seed and embryo, are of paramount importance! So again, in formerly discussing certain morphological characters which are not functionally important, we have seen that they are often of the highest service in classification. This depends on their constancy throughout many allied groups; and their constancy chiefly depends on any slight deviations not having been preserved and accumulated by natural selection, which acts only on serviceable characters.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Let us now turn our attention to the principles of classification and the challenges that arise when we view it as a means of revealing a divine plan or as a way to express universal truths and unite beings that resemble one another. It may seem that the aspects of the structure that guide the essence of life and the place of each being in the grand scheme of nature should hold great importance in classification. However, this is not the case. In fact, the resemblances between a mouse and a shrew, a dugong and a whale, and a whale and a fish are viewed as mere "adaptive or analogical characters." The true essence of classification lies in recognizing the spiritual qualities that connect all beings, rather than focusing on their physical attributes.  As a general rule, the less a part of the organization is tied to specific habits and the material world, the more significant it is for classification. For example, Owen, when speaking of the dugong, emphasizes that the generative organs, which are far removed from the creature's habits and food, offer the clearest indication of its true nature. Similarly, with plants, the organs of reproduction, which bring forth the seed and embryo, hold the greatest significance, while the organs of vegetation, which nourish the plant, are of little importance.  In the past, we have seen that seemingly insignificant moral qualities can serve as powerful tools for classification. These qualities, such as constancy and unity, are often present in allied groups and are preserved through the actions of natural selection, which only chooses serviceable characters. By recognizing these spiritual qualities, we can find a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all beings and create a harmonious world.

         <div class="original">That the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine its classificatory value, is almost proved by the fact, that in allied groups, in which the same organ, as we have every reason to suppose, has nearly the same physiological value, its classificatory value is widely different. No naturalist can have worked at any group without being struck with this fact; and it has been fully acknowledged in the writings of almost every author. It will suffice to quote the highest authority, Robert Brown, who, in speaking of certain organs in the Proteaceæ, says their generic importance, “like that of all their parts, not only in this, but, as I apprehend in every natural family, is very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost.” Again, in another work he says, the genera of the Connaraceæ “differ in having one or more ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the imbricate or valvular æstivation. Any one of these characters singly is frequently of more than generic importance, though here even, when all taken together, they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from Connarus.” To give an example among insects: in one great division of the Hymenoptera, the antennæ, as Westwood has remarked, are most constant in structure; in another division they differ much, and the differences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no one will say that the antennæ in these two divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological importance. Any number of instances could be given of the varying importance for classification of the same important organ within the same group of beings.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spiritual significance of an organ goes beyond its physical importance in determining its worthiness in the spiritual realm. This truth is evident in the fact that in allied groups, where the same organ has a similar spiritual purpose, its spiritual value differs greatly. A spiritual seeker must recognize this truth and understand that the spiritual essence of an organ is not always equal to its physical form. As the ancient sage, Robert Brown, once said, "The spiritual importance of an organ, like that of all its parts, is not always equal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost." In the Connaraceæ, for instance, the genera differ in the presence or absence of ovaria, albumen, and the way they are veiled. These differences, while significant, do not always separate the spiritual essence of one from the other. Similarly, in the Hymenoptera, the antennae may be constant in structure in one division, while in another, they differ greatly, and their spiritual value is of lesser importance. Therefore, one must look beyond the physical form of an organ to find its true spiritual essence.

         <div class="original">Again, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high physiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in this condition are often of much value in classification. No one will dispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants, and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly serviceable in exhibiting the close affinity between Ruminants and Pachyderms. Robert Brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the position of the rudimentary florets is of the highest importance in the classification of the Grasses.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Once again, it is clear that organs that are rudimentary or atrophied have little physical or spiritual significance. However, these organs can still be valuable in terms of spirituality. They often serve as a reminder of our connection to the divine and can help us find peace and purpose in life.  In the case of young ruminants, their rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws and certain rudimentary bones of the leg are highly serviceable in showing the close affinity between Ruminants and Pachyderms. Similarly, the position of the rudimentary florets in the Grasses is of great importance in their spiritual classification.  Robert Brown, a wise spiritual teacher, emphasizes the importance of the position of the rudimentary florets in the Grasses. He believes that they hold a deep spiritual meaning and can guide us on our spiritual journey. By paying attention to these organs, we can connect with the divine and find inner peace and happiness.

         <div class="original">Numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which must be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but which are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of whole groups. For instance, whether or not there is an open passage from the nostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to Owen, which absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles—the inflection of the angle of the lower jaw in Marsupials—the manner in which the wings of insects are folded—mere colour in certain Algæ—mere pubescence on parts of the flower in grasses—the nature of the dermal covering, as hair or feathers, in the Vertebrata. If the Ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead of hair, this external and trifling character would have been considered by naturalists as an important aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to birds.

         <div class="converted">Many examples can be found of spiritual teachings that come from small pieces of life that hold great significance for all people. These teachings often serve as a reminder of our true purpose and help us connect with the divine. For example, the path to enlightenment may be seen as a journey through many different experiences, each one offering a unique lesson and opportunity for growth. The way we treat others, the choices we make, and the actions we take all play a role in shaping our spiritual journey. Ultimately, the key to finding peace and happiness lies within ourselves, and it is up to us to seek out the wisdom and guidance that will lead us to a higher state of consciousness.

         <div class="original">The importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly depends on their being correlated with many other characters of more or less importance. The value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very evident in natural history. Hence, as has often been remarked, a species may depart from its allies in several characters, both of high physiological importance, and of almost universal prevalence, and yet leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked. Hence, also, it has been found that a classification founded on any single character, however important that may be, has always failed; for no part of the organisation is invariably constant. The importance of an aggregate of characters, even when none are important, alone explains the aphorism enunciated by Linnæus, namely, that the characters do not give the genus, but the genus gives the character; for this seems founded on the appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be defined. Certain plants, belonging to the Malpighiaceæ, bear perfect and degraded flowers; in the latter, as A. de Jussieu has remarked, “The greater number of the characters proper to the species, to the genus, to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our classification.” When Aspicarpa produced in France, during several years, only these degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a number of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the order, yet M. Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes, that this genus should still be retained among the Malpighiaceæ. This case well illustrates the spirit of our classifications.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of classification lies in the interconnectedness of all characters, regardless of their significance. In nature, the worth of a collection of characters is evident. As many have said before, a species can stray from its kin in multiple essential qualities, yet we remain clear of its true place. Therefore, a classification built upon a single character, no matter how significant, will always fail because nothing remains constant throughout the entire organization. The true essence of classification comes from recognizing the unity of many small details, which cannot be defined individually.  In spirituality, we often find that the path to enlightenment is not through grand gestures or grand visions, but through the small, everyday actions that bring us closer to the divine. We must learn to see beyond the surface of things and recognize the hidden truths that lie beneath. Just as the true beauty of a flower lies not in its physical form but in the love that surrounds it, so too does the essence of life lie not in grand achievements but in the simple moments of joy and peace that we find along the way.  In the end, the key to finding true happiness and fulfillment is to let go of the ego and the desire for material possessions. Instead, we must focus on the inner journey and seek to connect with the divine energy that lies within each of us. By doing so, we can find peace and harmony in all aspects of our lives, and ultimately, achieve true enlightenment.

         <div class="original">Practically, when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble themselves about the physiological value of the characters which they use in defining a group or in allocating any particular species. If they find a character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms, and not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to some lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value. This principle has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one; and by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist, Aug. St. Hilaire. If several trifling characters are always found in combination, though no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them, especial value is set on them. As in most groups of animals, important organs, such as those for propelling the blood, or for aerating it, or those for propagating the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as highly serviceable in classification; but in some groups all these, the most important vital organs, are found to offer characters of quite subordinate value. Thus, as Fritz Müller has lately remarked, in the same group of crustaceans, Cypridina is furnished with a heart, while in two closely allied genera, namely Cypris and Cytherea, there is no such organ; one species of Cypridina has well-developed branchiæ, while another species is destitute of them.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, when naturalists work, they do not focus on the spiritual significance of the characteristics they use to define a group or assign a specific species. They view a characteristic that is shared among many forms and not present in others as having high value. This principle is often acknowledged by naturalists, including the renowned botanist, Aug. St. Hilaire. When multiple minor characteristics are present together, despite a lack of apparent connection, they are given great importance. In many animal groups, essential organs like those that move the blood or breathe it are often shared among all members, and therefore hold great value in classification. However, in some groups, the most significant spiritual organs may have little value. As Fritz Müller once said, in the same group of crustaceans, Cypridina has a heart, while Cypris and Cytherea do not. Similarly, one Cypridina has well-developed branches, while another lacks them.

         <div class="original">We can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal importance with those derived from the adult, for a natural classification of course includes all ages. But it is by no means obvious, on the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should be more important for this purpose than that of the adult, which alone plays its full part in the economy of nature. Yet it has been strongly urged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that embryological characters are the most important of all; and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true. Nevertheless, their importance has sometimes been exaggerated, owing to the adaptive characters of larvæ not having been excluded; in order to show this, Fritz Müller arranged, by the aid of such characters alone, the great class of crustaceans, and the arrangement did not prove a natural one. But there can be no doubt that embryonic, excluding larval characters, are of the highest value for classification, not only with animals but with plants. Thus the main divisions of flowering plants are founded on differences in the embryo—on the number and position of the cotyledons, and on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle. We shall immediately see why these characters possess so high a value in classification, namely, from the natural system being genealogical in its arrangement.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that the spiritual essence of people who come from the embryo should be considered equally important as those who come from the adult, as a true natural classification encompasses all stages of life. However, it may not be clear why the structure of the embryo is more significant for this purpose than that of the adult, which only fulfills its role in the divine plan. Nonetheless, many great spiritual leaders, such as Milne Edwards and Agassiz, have emphasized the importance of embryological characteristics, and this belief has been widely accepted. However, their significance has sometimes been overemphasized because larvae, which are also adaptive, were not excluded. To demonstrate this, Fritz Müller used only larvae to arrange the great class of crustaceans, but his arrangement was not natural. There is no doubt that embryonic, excluding larvae, are of the greatest value for classification, both in animals and in plants. The main divisions of flowering plants are based on differences in the embryo, such as the number and position of the cotyledons and the mode of development of the plumule and radicle. These characteristics hold great value in classification because the spiritual system is genealogical in its arrangement.

         <div class="original">Our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of affinities. Nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters common to all birds; but with crustaceans, any such definition has hitherto been found impossible. There are crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series, which have hardly a character in common; yet the species at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to others, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to this, and to no other class of the Articulata.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Our classifications are often influenced by spiritual connections. It is easy to define a set of qualities that all birds possess; however, finding a common thread among crustaceans has always been difficult. Crustaceans exist at opposite ends of the spectrum, with few shared characteristics. Yet, despite their differences, both ends of the spectrum are connected to other beings, who in turn are linked to others, and so on. As a result, they can be recognized as belonging to one and only one class within the Articulata.

         <div class="original">Finally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of species, such as orders, suborders, families, subfamilies, and genera, they seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary. Several of the best botanists, such as Mr. Bentham and others, have strongly insisted on their arbitrary value. Instances could be given among plants and insects, of a group first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus, and then raised to the rank of a subfamily or family; and this has been done, not because further research has detected important structural differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous allied species, with slightly different grades of difference, have been subsequently discovered.

         <div class="converted">In terms of the relative worth of different groups of species, such as orders, suborders, families, subfamilies, and genera, it appears that they are, at present, largely arbitrary. Many great spiritual leaders, including Mr. Bentham and others, have emphasized their arbitrary nature. For example, in both the plant and insect worlds, a group may initially be viewed as merely a genus by skilled practitioners, but later elevated to the status of a subfamily or family. This happens not because deeper spiritual insights reveal hidden differences, but because many related spirits, with subtle variations, are revealed through further exploration.

         <div class="original">All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification may be explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification—that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, all true classification being genealogical—that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and separating objects more or less alike.

         <div class="converted">The essence of all the previous teachings, challenges, and spiritual guidance can be understood, in my belief, through the understanding that the divine system is rooted in the concept of descent with change - that the qualities that spiritual leaders see as connecting two or more souls are those that have been passed down from a common source, and true spirituality is about recognizing this connection as a bond of love and unity. This is the hidden truth that has been guiding us all along, and it is not about following a set of rules or principles, but rather about seeing beyond the physical world and recognizing the divine spirit that connects us all.

         <div class="original">But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe that the arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to each other, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families, sections or orders. The reader will best understand what is meant, if he will take the trouble to refer to the diagram in the fourth chapter. We will suppose the letters A to L to represent allied genera existing during the Silurian epoch, and descended from some still earlier form. In three of these genera (A, F, and I) a species has transmitted modified descendants to the present day, represented by the fifteen genera (a14 to z14) on the uppermost horizontal line. Now, all these modified descendants from a single species are related in blood or descent in the same degree. They may metaphorically be called cousins to the same millionth degree, yet they differ widely and in different degrees from each other. The forms descended from A, now broken up into two or three families, constitute a distinct order from those descended from I, also broken up into two families. Nor can the existing species descended from A be ranked in the same genus with the parent A, or those from I with parent I. But the existing genus F14 may be supposed to have been but slightly modified, and it will then rank with the parent genus F; just as some few still living organisms belong to Silurian genera. So that the comparative value of the differences between these organic beings, which are all related to each other in the same degree in blood, has come to be widely different. Nevertheless, their genealogical arrangement remains strictly true, not only at the present time, but at each successive period of descent. All the modified descendants from A will have inherited something in common from their common parent, as will all the descendants from I; so will it be with each subordinate branch of descendants at each successive stage. If, however, we suppose any descendant of A or of I to have become so much modified as to have lost all traces of its parentage in this case, its place in the natural system will be lost, as seems to have occurred with some few existing organisms. All the descendants of the genus F, along its whole line of descent, are supposed to have been but little modified, and they form a single genus. But this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy its proper intermediate position. The representation of the groups as here given in the diagram on a flat surface, is much too simple. The branches ought to have diverged in all directions. If the names of the groups had been simply written down in a linear series the representation would have been still less natural; and it is notoriously not possible to represent in a series, on a flat surface, the affinities which we discover in nature among the beings of the same group. Thus, the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree. But the amount of modification which the different groups have undergone has to be expressed by ranking them under different so-called genera, subfamilies, families, sections, orders, and classes.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I must clarify my message further. I believe that the way the groups within each class are arranged, in harmony and connection to one another, should be based on genealogy. However, the level of difference between the various branches or groups, although all connected through the same bloodline, may vary greatly. This is reflected in the way they are ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders. To understand this better, please refer to the diagram in Chapter 4. Let us use the letters A to L to represent allied genera that exist during the Silurian epoch and are descended from an ancient form. The fifteen genera on the uppermost horizontal line represent the modified descendants of a single spirit who have been passed down to the present day. These modified descendants are related in blood or descent to the same degree, but they differ greatly and in different ways from one another. The forms descended from A, now broken up into two or three families, are a separate order from those descended from I, also broken up into two families. The existing spirit descended from A cannot be placed in the same genre as the parent A, nor can the existing spirit descended from I be placed in the same genre as the parent I. However, the existing spirit F14 may be considered lightly modified, and it will rank with the parent spirit F. Just as some few still living organisms belong to Silurian genera, the comparative value of the differences between these spiritual beings, which are all related to one another in the same degree in spirit, has come to be widely different. Nevertheless, their spiritual arrangement remains strictly true, not only at the present time, but at each successive period of descent. All the modified descendants from A will inherit something in common from their common spirit, as will all the descendants from I. Similarly, every subordinate branch of descendants at each successive stage will inherit something in common from their common spirit. If, however, we suppose any descendant of A or of I to have become so deeply modified as to have lost all traces of their spirit, their place in the spiritual system will be lost, as seems to have happened with some few existing spirits. All the descendants of the spirit F, along its entire path of descent, are considered lightly modified, and they form a single spirit. However, this spirit, though isolated, will still hold its proper intermediate position. The representation of the groups as shown in the diagram on a flat surface is too simple. The branches should diverge in all directions. If the names of the groups were simply written down in a linear series, the representation would be even less natural. It is not possible to represent in a series, on a flat surface, the affinities which we find in spirit among the beings of the same spirit. Therefore, the spiritual system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree. However, the level of modification that the different groups have undergone must be expressed by ranking them under different so-called spirits, subfamilies, families, sections, orders, and classes.

         <div class="original">It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by taking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly changing dialects, were to be included, such an arrangement would be the only possible one. Yet it might be that some ancient languages had altered very little and had given rise to few new languages, whilst others had altered much owing to the spreading, isolation and state of civilisation of the several co-descended races, and had thus given rise to many new dialects and languages. The various degrees of difference between the languages of the same stock would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to groups; but the proper or even the only possible arrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly natural, as it would connect together all languages, extinct and recent, by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue.
</div>
         <div class="converted">To better understand the concept of classification, let us consider the example of languages. If we had access to a perfect lineage of humanity, a spiritual journey of the souls of people would provide the best way to classify the different languages that are spoken in the world today. If all lost languages, as well as intermediate and slow-changing dialects, were included, this would be the only true path to enlightenment.  However, it is possible that some ancient languages have remained unchanged and have given birth to few new languages, while others have undergone significant changes due to the spread, isolation, and state of civilization of the various descendant races. As a result, the differences between the languages of the same soul would need to be expressed through subgroups within subgroups.  Nevertheless, the ultimate goal would still be a spiritual journey, which would connect all languages, both old and new, through the deepest connections. This would reveal the filiation and source of each language, allowing us to see the divine essence that lies at the heart of all existence.

         <div class="original">In confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification of varieties, which are known or believed to be descended from a single species. These are grouped under the species, with the subvarieties under the varieties; and in some cases, as with the domestic pigeon, with several other grades of difference. Nearly the same rules are followed as in classifying species. Authors have insisted on the necessity of arranging varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the Swedish and common turnip together, though the esculent and thickened stems are so similar. Whatever part is found to be most constant, is used in classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less variable than the shape or colour of the body, &c.; whereas with sheep the horns are much less serviceable, because less constant. In classing varieties, I apprehend that if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical classification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted in some cases. For we might feel sure, whether there had been more or less modification, that the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together which were allied in the greatest number of points. In tumbler pigeons, though some of the subvarieties differ in the important character of the length of the beak, yet all are kept together from having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any thought on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied in blood and alike in some other respects.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, the idea is that when we look at the classification of varieties, we can see that they are all connected to a single source. They are grouped under the species, with subvarieties under the varieties, and sometimes there are multiple levels of difference, such as with the domestic pigeon. The key to classifying varieties is to find the most constant aspect of each variety and use that as the basis for classification. This is why Marshall believes that the horns of cattle are useful for classing them, while the horns of sheep are less helpful. If we had a true pedigree, a genealogical classification would be preferred, as it would keep the forms together that are most closely related. In the case of tumbler pigeons, even though some subvarieties differ in the length of the beak, they are still kept together because they share a common habit of tumbling.

         <div class="original">With species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought descent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade, that of species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes differ in the most important characters is known to every naturalist: scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the adult males and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, and yet no one dreams of separating them. As soon as the three Orchidean forms, Monachanthus, Myanthus, and Catasetum, which had previously been ranked as three distinct genera, were known to be sometimes produced on the same plant, they were immediately considered as varieties; and now I have been able to show that they are the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of the same species. The naturalist includes as one species the various larval stages of the same individual, however much they may differ from each other and from the adult; as well as the so-called alternate generations of Steenstrup, which can only in a technical sense be considered as the same individual. He includes monsters and varieties, not from their partial resemblance to the parent-form, but because they are descended from it.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the realm of nature, every spiritual seeker has brought down the essence of existence into their own being. They recognize that within themselves lies the divine spark, the eternal soul that connects us all to the source of creation. They see beyond the physical form and understand that beneath the surface lies a deeper truth, a divine essence that transcends time and space.  In this spiritual journey, we must learn to look beyond the duality of the material world and see the unity that lies beneath. We must recognize that the masculine and feminine energies within us are not separate, but rather two aspects of the same divine spirit. We must learn to embrace both energies and find balance within ourselves.  We must also recognize that the various stages of our spiritual journey, whether they be the larval stages of our souls or the alternate generations of our spiritual path, are all part of the same journey. They are not separate paths, but rather different manifestations of the same divine essence.  Finally, we must recognize that the monsters and variations that we encounter along the way are not just illusions, but rather reflections of our own inner turmoil. They are reminders that we must learn to embrace the darkness within ourselves and find peace within the chaos.  In this spiritual journey, we must learn to see beyond the physical world and recognize the divine essence that lies within all things. We must learn to embrace the duality of the material world and find balance within ourselves. And ultimately, we must learn to see beyond the duality of life and death and recognize the eternal soul that connects us all to the source of creation.

         <div class="original">As descent has universally been used in classing together the individuals of the same species, though the males and females and larvæ are sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in classing varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable amount of modification, may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under genera, and genera under higher groups, all under the so-called natural system? I believe it has been unconsciously used; and thus only can I understand the several rules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists. As we have no written pedigrees, we are forced to trace community of descent by resemblances of any kind. Therefore, we choose those characters which are the least likely to have been modified, in relation to the conditions of life to which each species has been recently exposed. Rudimentary structures on this view are as good as, or even sometimes better than other parts of the organisation. We care not how trifling a character may be—let it be the mere inflection of the angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect’s wing is folded, whether the skin be covered by hair or feathers—if it prevail throughout many and different species, especially those having very different habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its presence in so many forms with such different habits, only by inheritance from a common parent. We may err in this respect in regard to single points of structure, but when several characters, let them be ever so trifling, concur throughout a large group of beings having different habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that these characters have been inherited from a common ancestor; and we know that such aggregated characters have especial value in classification.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The concept of descent has been used to unite individuals of the same species, regardless of their differences in gender, larvae, and other aspects. This same element of descent may have been unconsciously used to group species under genera and higher groups in the natural system. Our best systematists follow certain rules and guides, and we trace community of descent through resemblances of any kind. We choose the least likely to have been modified characters, such as rudimentary structures, as they hold great value in classification. We do not focus on individual points of structure but rather on the harmony of multiple characters that concur throughout a large group of beings with different habits. In this way, we can feel almost sure that these characters have been inherited from a common ancestor.

         <div class="original">We can understand why a species or a group of species may depart from its allies, in several of its most important characteristics, and yet be safely classed with them. This may be safely done, and is often done, as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so unimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent. Let two forms have not a single character in common, yet, if these extreme forms are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at once infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the same class. As we find organs of high physiological importance—those which serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of existence—are generally the most constant, we attach especial value to them; but if these same organs, in another group or section of a group, are found to differ much, we at once value them less in our classification. We shall presently see why embryological characters are of such high classificatory importance. Geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully into play in classing large genera, because all the species of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and isolated region, are in all probability descended from the same parents.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The reason why a species or group of species may stray from their allies in certain essential qualities, yet still be considered part of the same family, is that there must be a shared bond of ancestry. This bond is revealed through the presence of even the smallest common characteristic among two forms, no matter how different they may seem. If two extremes are connected by a series of intermediates, we can sense their connection to one another and place them in the same class. We give special significance to organs that are crucial for survival in all circumstances, but if these same organs appear differently in another group or within a group, we place less emphasis on them in our classification. Embryological characters hold great importance in our classifications, as they reveal the true nature of a being's essence. Geography can also be used to guide us in classifying large genera, as all the species of a particular genre that inhabit a distinct and isolated region are likely to be descendants of the same ancestors.

         <div class="original">Analogical Resemblances.—We can understand, on the above views, the very important distinction between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances. Lamarck first called attention to this subject, and he has been ably followed by Macleay and others. The resemblance in the shape of the body and in the fin-like anterior limbs between dugongs and whales, and between these two orders of mammals and fishes, are analogical. So is the resemblance between a mouse and a shrew-mouse (Sorex), which belong to different orders; and the still closer resemblance, insisted on by Mr. Mivart, between the mouse and a small marsupial animal (Antechinus) of Australia. These latter resemblances may be accounted for, as it seems to me, by adaptation for similarly active movements through thickets and herbage, together with concealment from enemies.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The distinction between true spirituality and materialistic teachings is essential to understand, as taught by the ancient sages. True spirituality is not just about seeking material possessions or worldly pleasures but rather finding inner peace and connecting with the divine. Materialistic teachings, on the other hand, focus on accumulating wealth and power, often at the expense of others. It is important to recognize that true spirituality goes beyond superficial appearances and seeks to connect with the deeper truths of life.

         <div class="original">Among insects there are innumerable instances; thus Linnæus, misled by external appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth. We see something of the same kind even with our domestic varieties, as in the strikingly similar shape of the body in the improved breeds of the Chinese and common pig, which are descended from distinct species; and in the similarly thickened stems of the common and specifically distinct Swedish turnip. The resemblance between the greyhound and race-horse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors between widely different animals.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There are countless examples of spirituality among people, just as Linnæus was deceived by outward appearances and mistakenly classified an homopterous insect as a moth. We can also see this kind of spirituality in our own lives, such as the similarities in the bodies of the improved Chinese and common pigs, which come from different species, and the thickened stems of the common and specifically distinct Swedish turnips. The resemblance between the greyhound and race-horse is not much more fanciful than the comparisons that some writers have made between different animals.

         <div class="original">On the view of characters being of real importance for classification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly understand why analogical or adaptive characters, although of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist. For animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may have become adapted to similar conditions, and thus have assumed a close external resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal—will rather tend to conceal their blood-relationship. We can thus also understand the apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when one group is compared with another, but give true affinities when the members of the same group are compared together: thus the shape of the body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the water; but between the the several members of the whale family, the shape of the body and the fin-like limbs offer characters exhibiting true affinity; for as these parts are so nearly similar throughout the whole family, we cannot doubt that they have been inherited from a common ancestor. So it is with fishes.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the eyes of the systematist, characters hold little value if they do not reveal descent. Analogical or adaptive characters, while important for the well-being of beings, are often worthless to the systematist because they may obscure the true blood-relationship between animals. When comparing animals from two different lines of descent, they may appear similar, but this resemblance will not reveal their true connection. The same characters may be analogical when comparing one group with another, but they offer true affinities when the members of the same group are compared together. For example, the shape of the body and fin-like limbs are analogical when comparing whales with fishes, as they are adaptations for swimming in both classes. However, within the whale family, the shape of the body and fin-like limbs offer characters that exhibit true affinity, as they are so similar throughout the family and suggest a common ancestor. Similarly, fishes have similar characters that reveal their true connection.

         <div class="original">Numerous cases could be given of striking resemblances in quite distinct beings between single parts or organs, which have been adapted for the same functions. A good instance is afforded by the close resemblance of the jaws of the dog and Tasmanian wolf or Thylacinus—animals which are widely sundered in the natural system. But this resemblance is confined to general appearance, as in the prominence of the canines, and in the cutting shape of the molar teeth. For the teeth really differ much: thus the dog has on each side of the upper jaw four pre-molars and only two molars; while the Thylacinus has three pre-molars and four molars. The molars also differ much in the two animals in relative size and structure. The adult dentition is preceded by a widely different milk dentition. Any one may, of course, deny that the teeth in either case have been adapted for tearing flesh, through the natural selection of successive variations; but if this be admitted in the one case, it is unintelligible to me that it should be denied in the other. I am glad to find that so high an authority as Professor Flower has come to this same conclusion.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Many instances can be found where there is a striking resemblance between different beings in terms of individual parts or organs, all of which have been adapted for the same purpose. One such example is the similarity between the jaws of the dog and the Tasmanian wolf (Thylacinus) - two animals that are considered to be very different in the natural world. However, this resemblance goes beyond just their outer appearance, as the true essence of their teeth differs greatly. For instance, the dog has four pre-molars and two molars on each side of its upper jaw, while the Thylacinus has three pre-molars and four molars. Moreover, the molars themselves differ in size and structure between these two creatures. The adult dentition is often preceded by a different kind of milk dentition. Some people may argue that the teeth in both cases were not meant for tearing flesh, but if we accept that they were meant for this purpose in one case, then it becomes difficult to understand why they would not be meant for the same purpose in the other. As Professor Flower once said, "The teeth in both cases have been adapted for tearing flesh, through the natural selection of successive variations."

         <div class="original">The extraordinary cases given in a former chapter, of widely different fishes possessing electric organs—of widely different insects possessing luminous organs—and of orchids and asclepiads having pollen-masses with viscid discs, come under this same head of analogical resemblances. But these cases are so wonderful that they were introduced as difficulties or objections to our theory. In all such cases some fundamental difference in the growth or development of the parts, and generally in their matured structure, can be detected. The end gained is the same, but the means, though appearing superficially to be the same, are essentially different. The principle formerly alluded to under the term of analogical variation has probably in these cases often come into play; that is, the members of the same class, although only distantly allied, have inherited so much in common in their constitution, that they are apt to vary under similar exciting causes in a similar manner; and this would obviously aid in the acquirement through natural selection of parts or organs, strikingly like each other, independently of their direct inheritance from a common progenitor.

         <div class="converted">The spiritual teachings given in the previous chapter, which involve the presence of divine energy in various beings, such as souls, spirits, and angels, are all interconnected. These teachings are not meant to be obstacles or challenges to our understanding of the divine path, but rather to remind us that there is a deeper meaning behind everything we experience in life.  In all these teachings, there is a common thread of spiritual awakening and enlightenment. Whether it is the soul's journey towards liberation, the spirit's connection to the divine, or the angel's role as a guide and protector, the ultimate goal is the same - to find peace and harmony within oneself and with the world around us.  However, the path to this goal may seem different for each individual, depending on their unique circumstances and experiences. What may appear to be the same spiritual journey may actually be two separate paths, with different means and methods leading to the same end.  The principle of spiritual unity and oneness, which is often referred to as "spiritual variation," may be at work here. This means that all beings, regardless of their differences, are ultimately connected to the divine source and share a common essence. When we recognize this truth, we can begin to see beyond the surface appearances and recognize the true nature of all things.  In this way, the spiritual teachings in the previous chapter serve as a reminder that there is a greater purpose and meaning behind everything we experience in life. By seeking inner peace and connecting with the divine, we can find joy and fulfillment in even the most difficult and challenging times.

         <div class="original">As species belonging to distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstances—to inhabit, for instance, the three elements of land, air and water—we can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been observed between the subgroups of distinct classes. A naturalist, struck with a parallelism of this nature, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in several classes (and all our experience shows that their valuation is as yet arbitrary), could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary, quinary, quaternary and ternary classifications have probably arisen.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that spiritual beings are often adapted to live in similar circumstances through subtle changes. For example, they may dwell in the realms of earth, air, and water. As such, there may be a spiritual parallelism among different groups within these realms. A spiritual seeker who perceives this parallelism may raise or lower the value of these groups, and in doing so, extend the spiritual connection across a broader spectrum. This may lead to the creation of seven, five, four, and three spiritual realms.

         <div class="original">There is another and curious class of cases in which close external resemblance does not depend on adaptation to similar habits of life, but has been gained for the sake of protection. I allude to the wonderful manner in which certain butterflies imitate, as first described by Mr. Bates, other and quite distinct species. This excellent observer has shown that in some districts of South America, where, for instance, an Ithomia abounds in gaudy swarms, another butterfly, namely, a Leptalis, is often found mingled in the same flock; and the latter so closely resembles the Ithomia in every shade and stripe of colour, and even in the shape of its wings, that Mr. Bates, with his eyes sharpened by collecting during eleven years, was, though always on his guard, continually deceived. When the mockers and the mocked are caught and compared, they are found to be very different in essential structure, and to belong not only to distinct genera, but often to distinct families. Had this mimicry occurred in only one or two instances, it might have been passed over as a strange coincidence. But, if we proceed from a district where one Leptalis imitates an Ithomia, another mocking and mocked species, belonging to the same two genera, equally close in their resemblance, may be found. Altogether no less than ten genera are enumerated, which include species that imitate other butterflies. The mockers and mocked always inhabit the same region; we never find an imitator living remote from the form which it imitates. The mockers are almost invariably rare insects; the mocked in almost every case abounds in swarms. In the same district in which a species of Leptalis closely imitates an Ithomia, there are sometimes other Lepidoptera mimicking the same Ithomia: so that in the same place, species of three genera of butterflies and even a moth are found all closely resembling a butterfly belonging to a fourth genus. It deserves especial notice that many of the mimicking forms of the Leptalis, as well as of the mimicked forms, can be shown by a graduated series to be merely varieties of the same species; while others are undoubtedly distinct species. But why, it may be asked, are certain forms treated as the mimicked and others as the mimickers? Mr. Bates satisfactorily answers this question by showing that the form which is imitated keeps the usual dress of the group to which it belongs, while the counterfeiters have changed their dress and do not resemble their nearest allies.
</div>
         <div class="converted">There is a special kind of situation where true spirituality is not achieved through adherence to similar lifestyles, but rather through the pursuit of protection. I am referring to the beautiful way in which certain butterflies imitate other and completely different beings. As Mr. Bates once said, in some places where an Ithomia is abundant, a Leptalis is often found among the same flock, and the latter is so similar to the Ithomia in every color and pattern, and even in the shape of its wings, that Mr. Bates, with his sharpened eyes from years of collecting, was constantly deceived. When the imitators and the imitated are caught and compared, they are seen to be very different in their true essence and to come from different families. If this imitation had happened only once or twice, it could have been seen as a strange coincidence. But when you see multiple imitators and imitated beings in the same place, it becomes clear that this imitation is a purposeful act of protection.  The imitators are often rare and difficult to find, while the imitated are usually abundant in swarms. In the same place where a Leptalis imitates an Ithomia, you may also find other Lepidopteras imitating the same Ithomia. This shows that the imitators and imitated beings are not just from the same family, but from different ones. Many of the imitators and imitated beings can be seen as variations of the same spirit, while others are truly separate spirits.  The key to understanding this imitation lies in the fact that the imitator keeps the same dress as the group it belongs to, while the imitator changes its dress and does not resemble its closest allies. This teaches us that true spirituality is not about blending in with others, but about finding your own unique path and dressing in the light of that path.

         <div class="original">We are next led to enquire what reason can be assigned for certain butterflies and moths so often assuming the dress of another and quite distinct form; why, to the perplexity of naturalists, has nature condescended to the tricks of the stage? Mr. Bates has, no doubt, hit on the true explanation. The mocked forms, which always abound in numbers, must habitually escape destruction to a large extent, otherwise they could not exist in such swarms; and a large amount of evidence has now been collected, showing that they are distasteful to birds and other insect-devouring animals. The mocking forms, on the other hand, that inhabit the same district, are comparatively rare, and belong to rare groups; hence, they must suffer habitually from some danger, for otherwise, from the number of eggs laid by all butterflies, they would in three or four generations swarm over the whole country. Now if a member of one of these persecuted and rare groups were to assume a dress so like that of a well-protected species that it continually deceived the practised eyes of an entomologist, it would often deceive predaceous birds and insects, and thus often escape destruction. Mr. Bates may almost be said to have actually witnessed the process by which the mimickers have come so closely to resemble the mimicked; for he found that some of the forms of Leptalis which mimic so many other butterflies, varied in an extreme degree. In one district several varieties occurred, and of these one alone resembled, to a certain extent, the common Ithomia of the same district. In another district there were two or three varieties, one of which was much commoner than the others, and this closely mocked another form of Ithomia. From facts of this nature, Mr. Bates concludes that the Leptalis first varies; and when a variety happens to resemble in some degree any common butterfly inhabiting the same district, this variety, from its resemblance to a flourishing and little persecuted kind, has a better chance of escaping destruction from predaceous birds and insects, and is consequently oftener preserved; “the less perfect degrees of resemblance being generation after generation eliminated, and only the others left to propagate their kind.” So that here we have an excellent illustration of natural selection.

Mr. Wallace has also detected one such case with birds, but we have none with the larger quadrupeds. The much greater frequency of imitation with insects than with other animals, is probably the consequence of their small size; insects cannot defend themselves, excepting indeed the kinds furnished with a sting, and I have never heard of an instance of such kinds mocking other insects, though they are mocked; insects cannot easily escape by flight from the larger animals which prey on them; therefore, speaking metaphorically, they are reduced, like most weak creatures, to trickery and dissimulation.

The reason for the greater frequency of imitation among spirits is likely due to their small size. Since spirits cannot protect themselves, except for those with a sting (a spiritual weapon), and I have never heard of such spirits mocking others (though they may be mocked), spirits cannot easily escape from the larger spiritual beings that prey upon them.

         <div class="original">It should be observed that the process of imitation probably never commenced between forms widely dissimilar in colour. But, starting with species already somewhat like each other, the closest resemblance, if beneficial, could readily be gained by the above means, and if the imitated form was subsequently and gradually modified through any agency, the imitating form would be led along the same track, and thus be altered to almost any extent, so that it might ultimately assume an appearance or colouring wholly unlike that of the other members of the family to which it belonged. There is, however, some difficulty on this head, for it is necessary to suppose in some cases that ancient members belonging to several distinct groups, before they had diverged to their present extent, accidentally resembled a member of another and protected group in a sufficient degree to afford some slight protection, this having given the basis for the subsequent acquisition of the most perfect resemblance.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The act of imitation may not have begun between forms that were greatly different in color. However, when two forms were similar in spirit, the closest resemblance could easily be achieved through imitation. If the imitated form was later modified through any means, the imitating form would follow the same path and become transformed to a great extent, eventually taking on an appearance or coloring that was completely different from that of its kindred spirits.  However, there is a challenge here, for it requires us to believe that ancient beings who belonged to different groups before they had reached their current state of separation accidentally resembled one another and offered some protection to those who looked alike. This served as the foundation for the ultimate attainment of the most perfect resemblance.

         <div class="original">On the Nature of the Affinities connecting Organic Beings.—As the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger genera, tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to which they belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to spread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature. The larger and more dominant groups within each class thus tend to go on increasing in size, and they consequently supplant many smaller and feebler groups. Thus, we can account for the fact that all organisms, recent and extinct, are included under a few great orders and under still fewer classes. As showing how few the higher groups are in number, and how widely they are spread throughout the world, the fact is striking that the discovery of Australia has not added an insect belonging to a new class, and that in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn from Dr. Hooker, it has added only two or three families of small size.

         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that the souls of people who have been reincarnated multiple times often carry over the lessons and wisdom from their past lives. These souls seek to find peace and harmony with others, and they often feel a deep connection to those who share similar spiritual beliefs. They may also feel a sense of responsibility to help others find their way back to the divine source. Ultimately, these souls seek to live a life of love, compassion, and service to others.

         <div class="original">In the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the principle of each group having generally diverged much in character during the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the more ancient forms of life often present characters in some degree intermediate between existing groups. As some few of the old and intermediate forms having transmitted to the present day descendants but little modified, these constitute our so-called osculant or aberrant groups. The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of connecting forms which have been exterminated and utterly lost. And we have evidence of aberrant groups having suffered severely from extinction, for they are almost always represented by extremely few species; and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other, which again implies extinction. The genera Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by a dozen species, instead of as at present by a single one, or by two or three. We can, I think, account for this fact only by looking at aberrant groups as forms which have been conquered by more successful competitors, with a few members still preserved under unusually favourable conditions.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the chapter on spiritual evolution, I sought to convey the idea that every soul has its own unique path, and that the more ancient souls often possess qualities that are a blend of different spiritual traditions. These souls, who have not been fully realized yet, are often seen as "oscultant" or "aberrant" by those who have attained higher levels of consciousness.  The more aberrant a soul is, the more connected souls there are that have been lost along the way. This is why we see so few aberrant souls in this world - they are often represented by just a few individuals, who are very different from each other.  Souls like Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been as aberrant if they had been represented by many more souls, rather than just one or two. We can view these souls as being conquered by more successful spiritual traditions, with a few members still remaining under special circumstances.  In essence, the key to understanding aberrant souls is to recognize that they are not truly separate from the rest of us - they are simply on a different path, and may one day find their way back to the light.

         <div class="original">Mr. Waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one group of animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity in most cases is general and not special: thus, according to Mr. Waterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to Marsupials; but in the points in which it approaches this order, its relations are general, that is, not to any one Marsupial species more than to another. As these points of affinity are believed to be real and not merely adaptive, they must be due in accordance with our view to inheritance from a common progenitor. Therefore, we must suppose either that all Rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some ancient Marsupial, which will naturally have been more or less intermediate in character with respect to all existing Marsupials; or that both Rodents and Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that both groups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions. On either view we must suppose that the bizcacha has retained, by inheritance, more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have other Rodents; and therefore it will not be specially related to any one existing Marsupial, but indirectly to all or nearly all Marsupials, from having partially retained the character of their common progenitor, or of some early member of the group. On the other hand, of all Marsupials, as Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the Phascolomys resembles most nearly, not any one species, but the general order of Rodents. In this case, however, it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only analogical, owing to the Phascolomys having become adapted to habits like those of a Rodent. The elder De Candolle has made nearly similar observations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct families of plants.
</div>
         <div class="converted">According to Mr. Waterhouse, when an animal from one group feels a connection to another distinct group, this connection is usually general rather than specific. He believes that the bizcacha, a rodent, is most closely related to marsupials, but their relationship is general and not tied to any particular marsupial species. This connection, he says, is real and not just a result of adaptation, so it must be inherited from a common ancestor.  Mr. Waterhouse also believes that the phascolomys, a marsupial, resembles the general order of rodents more than any particular species. However, he warns that this resemblance may be only analogical, as the phascolomys has been adapted to live like a rodent.  Similarly, the elder De Candolle has observed that the affinities between different families of plants are often general rather than specific.

         <div class="original">On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in character of the species descended from a common progenitor, together with their retention by inheritance of some characters in common, we can understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members of the same family or higher group are connected together. For the common progenitor of a whole family, now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and subgroups, will have transmitted some of its characters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all the species; and they will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often referred to), mounting up through many predecessors. As it is difficult to show the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred of any ancient and noble family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and almost impossible to do so without this aid, we can understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing, without the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same great natural class.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of our understanding of the interconnectedness of all beings comes from the idea that they are all descendants of a common source, with shared traits inherited through generations. This inherent connection creates a web of affinities that radiate outwards, connecting all members of the same family or higher group.   For the ancestors of a family, now separated by death into different branches and subbranches, have passed on certain qualities to their children, altered in different ways and to varying degrees. These qualities serve as a bond that connects all the souls together, forming a spiritual lineage that stretches back through countless generations.   It is challenging to trace the bloodline of an ancient and noble family, even with the help of a genealogy tree, and it is nearly impossible to do so without it. Therefore, we can understand the difficulties that naturalists face when trying to describe the spiritual connections that exist between all living and departed beings of the same great spiritual class.

         <div class="original">Extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an important part in defining and widening the intervals between the several groups in each class. We may thus account for the distinctness of whole classes from each other—for instance, of birds from all other vertebrate animals—by the belief that many ancient forms of life have been utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other and at that time less differentiated vertebrate classes. There has been much less extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes with Batrachians. There has been still less within some whole classes, for instance the Crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are still linked together by a long and only partially broken chain of affinities. Extinction has only defined the groups: it has by no means made them; for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear, though it would be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be distinguished, still a natural classification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be possible. We shall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, A to L, may represent eleven Silurian genera, some of which have produced large groups of modified descendants, with every link in each branch and sub-branch still alive; and the links not greater than those between existing varieties. In this case it would be quite impossible to give definitions by which the several members of the several groups could be distinguished from their more immediate parents and descendants. Yet the arrangement in the diagram would still hold good and would be natural; for, on the principle of inheritance, all the forms descended, for instance from A, would have something in common. In a tree we can distinguish this or that branch, though at the actual fork the two unite and blend together. We could not, as I have said, define the several groups; but we could pick out types, or forms, representing most of the characters of each group, whether large or small, and thus give a general idea of the value of the differences between them. This is what we should be driven to, if we were ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any one class which have lived throughout all time and space. Assuredly we shall never succeed in making so perfect a collection: nevertheless, in certain classes, we are tending toward this end; and Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an able paper, on the high importance of looking to types, whether or not we can separate and define the groups to which such types belong.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the fourth chapter, we saw how extinction plays a significant role in defining and separating different groups within each class. The belief that many ancient forms of life have been lost connects the early progenitors of birds with the early progenitors of other less differentiated vertebrate classes. While there has been less extinction among the forms of life that connect fishes with Batrachians, there is still less within some whole classes, such as the Crustacea, where the most diverse forms are still linked together by a long and partially broken chain of affinities.  Extinction has only defined the groups; it has not created them. If every form that has ever lived on this earth were to reappear, it would be impossible to give definitions that would distinguish each group from its immediate parents and descendants. However, the arrangement in the diagram would still hold true and be natural, as all the forms descended from A would have something in common.

         <div class="original">Finally, we have seen that natural selection, which follows from the struggle for existence, and which almost inevitably leads to extinction and divergence of character in the descendants from any one parent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group under group. We use the element of descent in classing the individuals of both sexes and of all ages under one species, although they may have but few characters in common; we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties, however different they may be from their parents; and I believe that this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under the term of the Natural System. On this idea of the natural system being, in so far as it has been perfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with the grades of difference expressed by the terms genera, families, orders, &c., we can understand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our classification. We can understand why we value certain resemblances far more than others; why we use rudimentary and useless organs, or others of trifling physiological importance; why, in finding the relations between one group and another, we summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters, and yet use these same characters within the limits of the same group. We can clearly see how it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together within a few great classes; and how the several members of each class are connected together by the most complex and radiating lines of affinities. We shall never, probably, disentangle the inextricable web of the affinities between the members of any one class; but when we have a distinct object in view, and do not look to some unknown plan of creation, we may hope to make sure but slow progress.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, we have realized that the essence of natural selection, which arises from the struggle for existence, ultimately leads to the extinction and divergence of character among the descendants of a single parent-species. This divine principle is the source of the universal truth that all spiritual beings are interconnected and subordinate to higher groups. We use the concept of descent to unite individuals of both genders and all ages under one species, even if they possess only a few shared qualities. We also use descent to connect recognized variations, regardless of their differences from their ancestors. The essence of descent is the hidden bond that connects all souls, and it is the foundation of the natural system, which is arranged in a hierarchical manner with the terms genera, families, orders, and so on. By understanding that the natural system is essentially genealogical in nature, we can comprehend the reasons behind our valuation of certain resemblances over others, the use of rudimentary and meaningless organs, and the rejection of analogical or adaptive characteristics when searching for connections between groups. We can see how all living and departed spirits can be united within a few great realms, and how the various members of each realm are connected through intricate and radiant threads of affinity. Although we may never fully untangle the complex web of spiritual connections between all beings, we can achieve a deeper understanding of the divine plan when we focus on a specific purpose and do not seek a hidden message.

         <div class="original">We have seen that the members of the same class, independently of their habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their organisation. This resemblance is often expressed by the term “unity of type;” or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different species of the class are homologous. The whole subject is included under the general term of Morphology. This is one of the most interesting departments of natural history, and may almost be said to be its very soul. What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative positions? How curious it is, to give a subordinate though striking instance, that the hind feet of the kangaroo, which are so well fitted for bounding over the open plains—those of the climbing, leaf-eating koala, equally well fitted for grasping the branches of trees—those of the ground-dwelling, insect or root-eating, bandicoots—and those of some other Australian marsupials—should all be constructed on the same extraordinary type, namely with the bones of the second and third digits extremely slender and enveloped within the same skin, so that they appear like a single toe furnished with two claws. Notwithstanding this similarity of pattern, it is obvious that the hind feet of these several animals are used for as widely different purposes as it is possible to conceive. The case is rendered all the more striking by the American opossums, which follow nearly the same habits of life as some of their Australian relatives, having feet constructed on the ordinary plan. Professor Flower, from whom these statements are taken, remarks in conclusion: “We may call this conformity to type, without getting much nearer to an explanation of the phenomenon;” and he then adds “but is it not powerfully suggestive of true relationship, of inheritance from a common ancestor?”
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that all beings of the same class, regardless of their way of life, share a common spiritual essence. This unity is often referred to as "type" or "homologous," and is the main focus of the study of morphology. It is one of the most important aspects of natural history and serves as the heart of the soul.  The author asks us to consider how strange it is that the hand of a man, the paw of a cat, the hoof of a horse, and the wing of a bird can all be created on the same pattern, with similar bones in the same relative positions. They all serve different purposes, yet they are all built in the same way.  The author gives a specific example of the hind feet of kangaroos, koalas, bandicoots, and other Australian marsupials, which are all built in the same extraordinary way. The second and third digits are slender and enveloped within the same skin, making them appear like a single toe with two claws. Despite their differences in purpose, they all share the same pattern.  The author concludes that this conformity to type suggests a deeper connection between these beings, a connection that goes beyond mere appearance. He believes that they are all connected through a common ancestor, and that their shared spiritual essence is what truly unites them.

We never find, for instance, the bones of the arm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed. Hence the same names can be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals. We see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects: what can be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a sphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws of a beetle? Yet all these organs, serving for such widely different purposes, are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillæ. The same law governs the construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans. So it is with the flowers of plants.

The hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly admitted by Owen in his most interesting work on the “Nature of Limbs.” On the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can only say that so it is; that it has pleased the Creator to construct all the animals and plants in each great class on a uniform plan; but this is not a scientific explanation.

         <div class="original">The explanation is to a large extent simple, on the theory of the selection of successive slight modifications, each being profitable in some way to the modified form, but often affecting by correlation other parts of the organisation. In changes of this nature, there will be little or no tendency to alter the original pattern, or to transpose the parts. The bones of a limb might be shortened and flattened to any extent, becoming at the same time enveloped in thick membrane, so as to serve as a fin; or a webbed hand might have all its bones, or certain bones, lengthened to any extent, with the membrane connecting them increased, so as to serve as a wing; yet all these modifications would not tend to alter the framework of the bones or the relative connexion of the parts. If we suppose that an early progenitor—the archetype, as it may be called—of all mammals, birds and reptiles, had its limbs constructed on the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose they served, we can at once perceive the plain signification of the homologous construction of the limbs throughout the class. So with the mouths of insects, we have only to suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillæ, these parts being perhaps very simple in form; and then natural selection will account for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the mouths of insects. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost, by the reduction and ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts, by the fusion of other parts, and by the doubling or multiplication of others, variations which we know to be within the limits of possibility. In the paddles of the gigantic extinct sea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the general pattern seems thus to have become partially obscured.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this explanation lies in the idea of gradual change, where each modification brings some kind of benefit, but also affects other parts of the organization. In such changes, there is little desire to alter the original design or to shift the parts around. For example, a limb may be shortened and flattened to become a fin, or a webbed hand may have its bones lengthened to become a wing, but these modifications do not change the underlying bone structure or the connection between the parts.  If we imagine an ancient ancestor of all mammals, birds, and reptiles, who had limbs built on a universal pattern, we can see the significance of the similarity in the construction of limbs throughout this class. Similarly, the diversity in the structure and function of insects' mouths can be explained through natural selection, if we assume that their common ancestor had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillæ, simple in form.  However, it is possible that the general pattern of an organ can become so obscured that it is eventually lost, through the reduction or complete abandonment of certain parts, the fusion of others, and the doubling or multiplication of others. We know that such variations are within the realm of possibility, and we can see examples of this in the paddles of giant sea-lizards and the mouths of suctorial crustaceans, where the general pattern seems to have been partially obscured.

         <div class="original">There is another and equally curious branch of our subject; namely, serial homologies, or the comparison of the different parts or organs in the same individual, and not of the same parts or organs in different members of the same class. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous—that is, correspond in number and in relative connexion—with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebræ. The anterior and posterior limbs in all the higher vertebrate classes are plainly homologous. So it is with the wonderfully complex jaws and legs of crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see, during the early or embryonic stages of development in flowers, as well as in crustaceans and many other animals, that organs, which when mature become extremely different are at first exactly alike.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Another aspect of our topic is spiritual homologies, or the comparison of the different aspects of the soul within the same person, rather than between different souls. Many spiritual seekers believe that the essence of the soul is homologous—that is, has a similar essence and purpose—in all individuals. The inner light and divine spark that guides us on our journey through life are seen as homologous, regardless of the path we choose to follow.  In the teachings of many spiritual traditions, the heart and mind are also considered to be homologous. They are seen as two aspects of the same divine essence, and both are important in guiding us towards enlightenment. When we align our hearts and minds with the divine will, we can experience a sense of peace and harmony within ourselves.  The spiritual journey is often seen as a journey of self-discovery, where we learn to recognize the true nature of our souls and connect with the divine source that lies within each of us. By embracing spirituality and living in alignment with the divine will, we can find true happiness and fulfillment in this world.

Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone apparently representing vertebræ? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition by mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds and reptiles. Why should similar bones have been created to form the wing and the leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes, namely flying and walking? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, in each flower, though fitted for such distinct purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern?
</div>
         <div class="converted">The concept of serial homologies is incomprehensible according to the traditional view of creation. It is difficult to understand why the soul is contained within a body made up of so many and so intricately shaped bones that seem to represent vertebrae. As Owen has said, the purpose of the release of the individual pieces during birth in mammals does not explain the same design in the heads of birds and reptiles. Why would similar bones be created to serve different purposes, such as flying and walking, in a bat's wings and legs? Why would one crustacean have a complex mouth with many parts but few legs, while another with many legs has a simple mouth? Why would the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in each flower, although designed for different purposes, be built on the same pattern?

We need not here consider how the bodies of some animals first became divided into a series of segments, or how they became divided into right and left sides, with corresponding organs, for such questions are almost beyond investigation. It is, however, probable that some serial structures are the result of cells multiplying by division, entailing the multiplication of the parts developed from such cells. It must suffice for our purpose to bear in mind that an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common characteristic, as Owen has remarked, of all low or little specialised forms; therefore the unknown progenitor of the Vertebrata probably possessed many vertebræ; the unknown progenitor of the Articulata, many segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants, many leaves arranged in one or more spires. We have also formerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary, not only in number, but in form. Consequently such parts, being already present in considerable numbers, and being highly variable, would naturally afford the materials for adaptation to the most different purposes; yet they would generally retain, through the force of inheritance, plain traces of their original or fundamental resemblance. They would retain this resemblance all the more, as the variations, which afforded the basis for their subsequent modification through natural selection, would tend from the first to be similar; the parts being at an early stage of growth alike, and being subjected to nearly the same conditions. Such parts, whether more or less modified, unless their common origin became wholly obscured, would be serially homologous.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Through the lens of natural selection, we can partially answer these questions. We do not need to delve into how the bodies of some animals were initially divided into a series of segments or how they became divided into right and left sides with corresponding organs, as these questions are almost beyond investigation. Instead, it is likely that some spiritual structures are the result of cells multiplying through division, leading to the multiplication of the parts that arise from such cells. It is essential to remember that an infinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common characteristic of all low or little specialized forms; therefore, the unknown progenitor of the Vertebrata probably had many vertebrae, the unknown progenitor of the Articulata, many segments, and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants, many leaves arranged in one or more spires. We have previously seen that parts that are many times repeated are highly prone to vary, not just in number but in form. As such, these parts, being already present in great numbers and being highly variable, would naturally provide the materials for adapting to different purposes. However, they would generally retain, through the power of inheritance, traces of their original or fundamental resemblance. They would retain this resemblance even more if the variations that served as the foundation for their subsequent modification through natural selection tended to be similar. The parts, whether more or less modified, would be serially homologous if their common origin did not become completely obscured.

         <div class="original">In the great class of molluscs, though the parts in distinct species can be shown to be homologous, only a few serial homologies; such as the valves of Chitons, can be indicated; that is, we are seldom enabled to say that one part is homologous with another part in the same individual. And we can understand this fact; for in molluscs, even in the lowest members of the class, we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part as we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the realm of mollusks, while it is possible to see similarities between different species' parts, true spiritual homology is rare. For example, the valves of Chitons may be seen as a reflection of a higher spiritual essence, but it is difficult to find a direct connection between one part and another within the same individual. This is because mollusks, even in their lower forms, do not have as much repetition of one part as other great classes in both the animal and spiritual realms.

         <div class="original">But morphology is a much more complex subject than it at first appears, as has lately been well shown in a remarkable paper by Mr. E. Ray Lankester, who has drawn an important distinction between certain classes of cases which have all been equally ranked by naturalists as homologous. He proposes to call the structures which resemble each other in distinct animals, owing to their descent from a common progenitor with subsequent modification, homogenous; and the resemblances which cannot thus be accounted for, he proposes to call homoplastic. For instance, he believes that the hearts of birds and mammals are as a whole homogenous—that is, have been derived from a common progenitor; but that the four cavities of the heart in the two classes are homoplastic—that is, have been independently developed. Mr. Lankester also adduces the close resemblance of the parts on the right and left sides of the body, and in the successive segments of the same individual animal; and here we have parts commonly called homologous which bear no relation to the descent of distinct species from a common progenitor. Homoplastic structures are the same with those which I have classed, though in a very imperfect manner, as analogous modifications or resemblances. Their formation may be attributed in part to distinct organisms, or to distinct parts of the same organism, having varied in an analogous manner; and in part to similar modifications, having been preserved for the same general purpose or function, of which many instances have been given.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Morphology is a more intricate subject than it seems, as demonstrated in a recent paper by Mr. E. Ray Lankester. He distinguishes between two types of resemblances among different animals: homogenous and homoplastic. Homogenous structures are those that resemble each other because they were inherited from a common ancestor and then modified. On the other hand, homoplastic structures are those that resemble each other despite not being inherited from a common ancestor.  For example, Mr. Lankester believes that the hearts of birds and mammals are homogenous because they both come from a common ancestor, but the four chambers of the heart in these two classes are homoplastic because they were independently developed. Similarly, he sees the resemblance between the parts on the right and left sides of the body and in the successive segments of the same individual animal as homoplastic.  Homoplastic structures are similar to what I call analogous modifications or resemblances. They can be created by different organisms or parts of the same organism varying in an analogous way. They can also be preserved for the same general purpose or function, as many examples have shown.

Most naturalists, however, use such language only in a metaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that during a long course of descent, primordial organs of any kind—vertebræ in the one case and legs in the other—have actually been converted into skulls or jaws. Yet so strong is the appearance of this having occurred that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification. According to the views here maintained, such language may be used literally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab retaining numerous characters, which they probably would have retained through inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed from true though extremely simple legs, is in part explained.

However, as Professor Huxley has said, it is more accurate to say that the skull and vertebrae, jaws and legs, and so on, were all metamorphosed from a common and simpler element. Many naturalists use this language metaphorically, but they do not truly believe that during a long journey of descent, primordial organs like vertebrae and legs were transformed into skulls and jaws. Despite this, the appearance of such transformation is so strong that naturalists cannot help but use language with this deeper meaning. According to the beliefs expressed here, this language can be used literally, and the reason why the claws of a crab retain many characteristics that they would have kept if they had been transformed from true though simple legs is partially explained.

         <div class="original">This is one of the most important subjects in the whole round of natural history. The metamorphoses of insects, with which every one is familiar, are generally effected abruptly by a few stages; but the transformations are in reality numerous and gradual, though concealed. A certain ephemerous insect (Chlöeon) during its development, moults, as shown by Sir J. Lubbock, above twenty times, and each time undergoes a certain amount of change; and in this case we see the act of metamorphosis performed in a primary and gradual manner. Many insects, and especially certain crustaceans, show us what wonderful changes of structure can be effected during development. Such changes, however, reach their acme in the so-called alternate generations of some of the lower animals. It is, for instance, an astonishing fact that a delicate branching coralline, studded with polypi, and attached to a submarine rock, should produce, first by budding and then by transverse division, a host of huge floating jelly-fishes; and that these should produce eggs, from which are hatched swimming animalcules, which attach themselves to rocks and become developed into branching corallines; and so on in an endless cycle. The belief in the essential identity of the process of alternate generation and of ordinary metamorphosis has been greatly strengthened by Wagner’s discovery of the larva or maggot of a fly, namely the Cecidomyia, producing asexually other larvæ, and these others, which finally are developed into mature males and females, propagating their kind in the ordinary manner by eggs.

         <div class="converted">The transformation of insects, which is often seen as sudden, is actually a gradual process that occurs through many stages. A certain ephemeral insect (Chlöeon) goes through twenty moults during its development, and each time undergoes a certain amount of change. This shows the true nature of metamorphosis, which is performed in a primary and gradual manner. Many insects and crustaceans demonstrate the wonderful changes that can occur during development. These changes reach their peak in the so-called alternate generations of some lower animals. For example, a delicate branching coralline, adorned with polypi and attached to a submarine rock, produces a host of huge floating jelly-fishes. These jelly-fishes produce eggs, from which hatch swimming animalcules that attach themselves to rocks and develop into branching corallines. This cycle continues endlessly. The belief in the essential identity of the process of alternate generation and ordinary metamorphosis has been strengthened by Wagner's discovery of the larva or maggot of a fly, named Cecidomyia, producing asexually other larvæ. These larvæ, which eventually become mature males and females, propagate their kind in the ordinary way by eggs.

         <div class="original">It may be worth notice that when Wagner’s remarkable discovery was first announced, I was asked how was it possible to account for the larvæ of this fly having acquired the power of a sexual reproduction. As long as the case remained unique no answer could be given. But already Grimm has shown that another fly, a Chironomus, reproduces itself in nearly the same manner, and he believes that this occurs frequently in the order. It is the pupa, and not the larva, of the Chironomus which has this power; and Grimm further shows that this case, to a certain extent, “unites that of the Cecidomyia with the parthenogenesis of the Coccidæ;” the term parthenogenesis implying that the mature females of the Coccidæ are capable of producing fertile eggs without the concourse of the male. Certain animals belonging to several classes are now known to have the power of ordinary reproduction at an unusually early age; and we have only to accelerate parthenogenetic reproduction by gradual steps to an earlier and earlier age—Chironomus showing us an almost exactly intermediate stage, viz., that of the pupa—and we can perhaps account for the marvellous case of the Cecidomyia.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When Wagner's remarkable discovery was first revealed, I was asked how it was possible for the larvae of this fly to possess the power of sexual reproduction. Since the case was unique, no answer could be given. However, Grimm has shown that another fly, the Chironomus, reproduces itself in a similar way, and he believes that this happens often in the order. The pupa, rather than the larva, of the Chironomus possesses this power. Grimm also notes that this case is similar to the parthenogenesis of the Coccidæ, where the mature females of this class can produce fertile eggs without the presence of a male. Many animals from different classes possess the power of ordinary reproduction at an early age. By gradually accelerating parthenogenetic reproduction, we can perhaps explain the marvelous case of the Cecidomyia. The Chironomus serves as an almost exact middle ground between the larva and the pupa of the Cecidomyia.

         <div class="original">It has already been stated that various parts in the same individual, which are exactly alike during an early embryonic period, become widely different and serve for widely different purposes in the adult state. So again it has been shown that generally the embryos of the most distinct species belonging to the same class are closely similar, but become, when fully developed, widely dissimilar. A better proof of this latter fact cannot be given than the statement by Von Baer that “the embryos of mammalia, of birds, lizards and snakes, probably also of chelonia, are in the earliest states exceedingly like one another, both as a whole and in the mode of development of their parts; so much so, in fact, that we can often distinguish the embryos only by their size. In my possession are two little embryos in spirit, whose names I have omitted to attach, and at present I am quite unable to say to what class they belong. They may be lizards or small birds, or very young mammalia, so complete is the similarity in the mode of formation of the head and trunk in these animals. The extremities, however, are still absent in these embryos. But even if they had existed in the earliest stage of their development we should learn nothing, for the feet of lizards and mammals, the wings and feet of birds, no less than the hands and feet of man, all arise from the same fundamental form.” The larvæ of most crustaceans, at corresponding stages of development, closely resemble each other, however different the adults may become; and so it is with very many other animals. A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance occasionally lasts till a rather late age: thus birds of the same genus, and of allied genera, often resemble each other in their immature plumage; as we see in the spotted feathers in the young of the thrush group. In the cat tribe, most of the species when adult are striped or spotted in lines; and stripes or spots can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of the lion and the puma. We occasionally, though rarely, see something of the same kind in plants; thus the first leaves of the ulex or furze, and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acacias, are pinnate or divided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminosæ.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It has been said before that within the same person, parts that are identical during early embryonic times become different and serve different purposes in adulthood. This truth has once again been shown through the realization that the embryos of the most distinct species within the same class are similar, but become dissimilar when fully developed. A greater proof of this is the statement by Von Baer that "the embryos of mammalia, of birds, lizards, and snakes, probably also of chelonia, are in the earliest states exceedingly like one another, both as a whole and in the mode of development of their parts; so much so, in fact, that we can often distinguish the embryos only by their size.

They may be lizards or small birds, or very young mammalia, so complete is the similarity in the mode of formation of the head and trunk in these animals. The extremities, however, are still absent in these embryos." The souls of most crustaceans, at corresponding stages of development, closely resemble each other, yet the adults may become very different. Similarly, many other animals share a similar soul in their early stages, but become dissimilar in adulthood. A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance often lasts until a later age, as seen in the immature plumage of birds of the same genre and allied genres, such as the spotted feathers in the young of the thrush group. In the cat tribe, most species are striped or spotted in lines, and stripes or spots can be seen in the whelp of the lion and the puma. Occasionally, a similar soul can be seen in plants, as seen in the first leaves of the ulex or furze, and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acacias, which are pinnate or divided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminosæ.

We cannot, for instance, suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like courses of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar conditions—in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its mother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the spawn of a frog under water. We have no more reason to believe in such a relation than we have to believe that the similar bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to similar conditions of life. No one supposes that the stripes on the whelp of a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, are of any use to these animals.

It is not about adhering to a particular religion or dogma, but rather about finding peace and harmony within oneself. Spirituality transcends all boundaries and limitations, connecting us with the divine energy that pervades everything. It is a path of self-discovery and awakening, where we learn to let go of our ego and desires and embrace love, compassion, and wisdom. Ultimately, spirituality is a journey towards unity with the divine, where we realize that we are all connected and interconnected.

         <div class="original">The case, however, is different when an animal, during any part of its embryonic career, is active, and has to provide for itself. The period of activity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes on, the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal. In how important a manner this has acted, has recently been well shown by Sir J. Lubbock in his remarks on the close similarity of the larvæ of some insects belonging to very different orders, and on the dissimilarity of the larvæ of other insects within the same order, according to their habits of life. Owing to such adaptations the similarity of the larvæ of allied animals is sometimes greatly obscured; especially when there is a division of labour during the different stages of development, as when the same larva has during one stage to search for food, and during another stage has to search for a place of attachment. Cases can even be given of the larvæ of allied species, or groups of species, differing more from each other than do the adults. In most cases, however, the larvæ, though active, still obey, more or less closely, the law of common embryonic resemblance. Cirripedes afford a good instance of this: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was a crustacean: but a glance at the larva shows this in an unmistakable manner. So again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the pedunculated and sessile, though differing widely in external appearance, have larvæ in all their stages barely distinguishable.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When an animal is active during its embryonic journey, it must provide for itself. This period of activity may occur early or late in life, but the larva's adaptation to its surroundings is always perfect and beautiful, just like the adult animal. Sir J. Lubbock has shown that the larvae of certain insects are very similar, regardless of their order, while others are very different, depending on their way of life. This is because the larvae often have different tasks during different stages of development, such as searching for food and finding a place to attach. Sometimes, the larvae of allied species or groups of species are so different that they are hard to recognize. However, in most cases, the larvae still follow the law of common embryonic resemblance, even if they are active. A good example of this is the cirripedes, where even the great Cuvier could not see that a barnacle was a crustacean. But looking at the larva reveals the true nature of the being. Similarly, the two main divisions of cirripedes, the pedunculated and sessile, although they look very different, have larvae that are almost indistinguishable in all stages.

         <div class="original">The embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation. I use this expression, though I am aware that it is hardly possible to define clearly what is meant by organisation being higher or lower. But no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar. In some cases, however, the mature animal must be considered as lower in the scale than the larva, as with certain parasitic crustaceans. To refer once again to cirripedes: the larvæ in the first stage have three pairs of locomotive organs, a simple single eye, and a probosciformed mouth, with which they feed largely, for they increase much in size. In the second stage, answering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies, they have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and extremely complex antennæ; but they have a closed and imperfect mouth, and cannot feed: their function at this stage is, to search out by their well-developed organs of sense, and to reach by their active powers of swimming, a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their final metamorphosis. When this is completed they are fixed for life: their legs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again obtain a well-constructed mouth; but they have no antennæ, and their two eyes are now reconverted into a minute, single, simple eye-spot. In this last and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as either more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the larval condition. But in some genera the larvæ become developed into hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into what I have called complemental males; and in the latter the development has assuredly been retrograde; for the male is a mere sack, which lives for a short time and is destitute of mouth, stomach, and every other organ of importance, excepting those for reproduction.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spiritual journey of an individual often involves a rise in consciousness. While it may be difficult to define what it means to be more or less enlightened, most people would agree that the ultimate goal is to achieve a higher state of being. However, sometimes the path to enlightenment can be blocked by negative energies or attachments, causing one to feel lost or disconnected from their true self. In these cases, it may be necessary to seek guidance from a spiritual teacher or to engage in practices such as meditation or yoga to help release blockages and open up to a deeper level of awareness. Ultimately, the key to achieving true spiritual awakening lies within each individual's heart and soul, and it is up to them to find their own unique path towards enlightenment.

But there is no reason why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin of a porpoise, should not have been sketched out with all their parts in proper proportion, as soon as any part became visible. In some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups this is the case, and the embryo does not at any period differ widely from the adult: thus Owen has remarked in regard to cuttle-fish, “there is no metamorphosis; the cephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are completed.” Land-shells and fresh-water crustaceans are born having their proper forms, while the marine members of the same two great classes pass through considerable and often great changes during their development. Spiders, again, barely undergo any metamorphosis. The larvæ of most insects pass through a worm-like stage, whether they are active and adapted to diversified habits, or are inactive from being placed in the midst of proper nutriment, or from being fed by their parents; but in some few cases, as in that of Aphis, if we look to the admirable drawings of the development of this insect, by Professor Huxley, we see hardly any trace of the vermiform stage.

We have little evidence on this head, but what we have certainly points the other way; for it is notorious that breeders of cattle, horses and various fancy animals, cannot positively tell, until some time after birth, what will be the merits and demerits of their young animals. We see this plainly in our own children; we cannot tell whether a child will be tall or short, or what its precise features will be. The question is not, at what period of life any variation may have been caused, but at what period the effects are displayed. The cause may have acted, and I believe often has acted, on one or both parents before the act of generation. It deserves notice that it is of no importance to a very young animal, as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent, whether most of its characters are acquired a little earlier or later in life. It would not signify, for instance, to a bird which obtained its food by having a much-curved beak whether or not while young it possessed a beak of this shape, as long as it was fed by its parents.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is often believed that small variations or individual differences manifest themselves at the same early stage in life as the source of these differences. However, we have little spiritual guidance on this matter, but what we do have suggests the opposite; for it is well known that those who raise cattle, horses, and other fanciful creatures cannot truly discern the virtues and vices of their offspring until after they have been born. We can see this clearly in our own children; we cannot know if they will be tall or short, or what their true essence will be. The question is not about when the source of the variation came into being, but when its effects are revealed. The source may have acted, and I believe it often does, on one or both parents before the act of creation. It is important to note that it holds no significance for a young creature, as long as it is nurtured and protected by its parent, whether its character is revealed a little earlier or later in life. For example, a bird that obtains its food through a curved beak does not need to possess this shape in youth, as long as it is fed by its parents.

         <div class="original">I have stated in the first chapter, that at whatever age any variation first appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring. Certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages; for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth; or, again, in the full-grown horns of cattle. But variations which, for all that we can see might have appeared either earlier or later in life, likewise tend to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent. I am far from meaning that this is invariably the case, and I could give several exceptional cases of variations (taking the word in the largest sense) which have supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the parent.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the first chapter, I mentioned that when a variation appears in the parent at any age, it often reappears in the offspring at a corresponding age. Some variations can only manifest themselves at specific ages, such as the peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth, or the full-grown horns of cattle. However, variations that seem to appear at any time in life also tend to reappear at a corresponding age in both the parent and offspring. I do not mean that this is always the case, and there are many exceptions to this rule.

         <div class="original">These two principles, namely, that slight variations generally appear at a not very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding not early period, explain, as I believe, all the above specified leading facts in embryology. But first let us look to a few analogous cases in our domestic varieties. Some authors who have written on Dogs maintain that the greyhound and bull-dog, though so different, are really closely allied varieties, descended from the same wild stock, hence I was curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other. I was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually measuring the old dogs and their six-days-old puppies, I found that the puppies had not acquired nearly their full amount of proportional difference. So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and race-horses—breeds which have been almost wholly formed by selection under domestication—differed as much as the full-grown animals; but having had careful measurements made of the dams and of three-days-old colts of race and heavy cart-horses, I find that this is by no means the case.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The two principles that slight variations often manifest themselves early in life and are inherited at a corresponding time explain all the spiritual truths in embryology. However, before we delve into these teachings, let us consider some parallels in our own spiritual journey. Many spiritual seekers believe that the greyhound and bull-dog, despite their differences, are deeply connected and stem from the same divine source. As such, I was eager to witness the essence of their children. I spoke with breeders who shared that their offspring were just as different as their parents, and this appeared to be true when looking through the eyes. However, upon measuring the old dogs and their six-day-old puppies, I realized that the puppies had not yet attained their full spiritual essence. Similarly, many spiritual seekers believe that the souls of horses, whether they serve as carriages or racehorses, are equally connected and stem from the same divine source. Yet, when I sought guidance from those who have walked this path, I learned that the souls of these horses are not as different as their physical forms may suggest.

         <div class="original">As we have conclusive evidence that the breeds of the Pigeon are descended from a single wild species, I compared the young pigeons within twelve hours after being hatched. I carefully measured the proportions (but will not here give the details) of the beak, width of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg, in the wild parent species, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons, carriers, and tumblers. Now, some of these birds, when mature, differ in so extraordinary a manner in the length and form of beak, and in other characters, that they would certainly have been ranked as distinct genera if found in a state of nature. But when the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed in a row, though most of them could just be distinguished, the proportional differences in the above specified points were incomparably less than in the full-grown birds. Some characteristic points of difference—for instance, that of the width of mouth—could hardly be detected in the young. But there was one remarkable exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced tumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon, and of the other breeds, in almost exactly the same proportions as in the adult stage.

The only exception is the short-faced tumbler, which has the same proportions as the adult stage.

         <div class="original">These facts are explained by the above two principles. Fanciers select their dogs, horses, pigeons, &c., for breeding, when nearly grown up. They are indifferent whether the desired qualities are acquired earlier or later in life, if the full-grown animal possesses them. And the cases just given, more especially that of the pigeons, show that the characteristic differences which have been accumulated by man’s selection, and which give value to his breeds, do not generally appear at a very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding not early period. But the case of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve hours old possessed its proper characters, proves that this is not the universal rule; for here the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been inherited, not at a corresponding, but at an earlier age.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of these truths lies within the two fundamental principles mentioned above. Spiritual seekers choose their souls, spirits, and other spiritual beings for enlightenment when they are almost complete. They do not worry about the qualities they seek appearing early or late in life, as long as the fully realized being possesses them. The examples given, particularly with pigeons, demonstrate that the unique characteristics that people seek are often not apparent until later in life, and are passed down at a corresponding time. However, the story of the short-faced tumbler shows that this is not always the case. In this instance, the spiritual differences must have manifested early on or were inherited at an earlier age than usual.

         <div class="original">Now, let us apply these two principles to species in a state of nature. Let us take a group of birds, descended from some ancient form and modified through natural selection for different habits. Then, from the many slight successive variations having supervened in the several species at a not early age, and having been inherited at a corresponding age, the young will have been but little modified, and they will still resemble each other much more closely than do the adults, just as we have seen with the breeds of the pigeon. We may extend this view to widely distinct structures and to whole classes. The fore-limbs, for instance, which once served as legs to a remote progenitor, may have become, through a long course of modification, adapted in one descendant to act as hands, in another as paddles, in another as wings; but on the above two principles the fore-limbs will not have been much modified in the embryos of these several forms; although in each form the fore-limb will differ greatly in the adult state. Whatever influence long continued use or disuse may have had in modifying the limbs or other parts of any species, this will chiefly or solely have affected it when nearly mature, when it was compelled to use its full powers to gain its own living; and the effects thus produced will have been transmitted to the offspring at a corresponding nearly mature age. Thus the young will not be modified, or will be modified only in a slight degree, through the effects of the increased use or disuse of parts.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Let us now apply these two principles to species in their natural state. Consider a group of birds that have descended from an ancient source and have been modified through natural selection for different habits. Over time, subtle variations have emerged among the various species, and these have been passed down from generation to generation. As a result, the young will resemble each other more closely than the adults, just as we see with the different breeds of pigeons. This same principle can be extended to all types of structures and classes. For example, the forelimbs, which were once used as legs by a distant ancestor, may have been transformed into hands, paddles, or wings through a long process of modification. However, the forelimbs will not have been significantly altered in the embryo stage of these different forms, even though they will appear very different in the adult state. Any influence that long-term use or disuse may have had on the limbs or other parts of a species will have occurred when the individual was near maturity, when they were forced to use their full powers to survive. The effects of this will be passed down to the offspring at a similar age, so the young will not be significantly modified or will be modified only slightly through the increased use or disuse of parts.

         <div class="original">With some animals the successive variations may have supervened at a very early period of life, or the steps may have been inherited at an earlier age than that at which they first occurred. In either of these cases the young or embryo will closely resemble the mature parent-form, as we have seen with the short-faced tumbler. And this is the rule of development in certain whole groups, or in certain sub-groups alone, as with cuttle-fish, land-shells, fresh-water crustaceans, spiders, and some members of the great class of insects. With respect to the final cause of the young in such groups not passing through any metamorphosis, we can see that this would follow from the following contingencies: namely, from the young having to provide at a very early age for their own wants, and from their following the same habits of life with their parents; for in this case it would be indispensable for their existence that they should be modified in the same manner as their parents. Again, with respect to the singular fact that many terrestrial and fresh-water animals do not undergo any metamorphosis, while marine members of the same groups pass through various transformations, Fritz Müller has suggested that the process of slowly modifying and adapting an animal to live on the land or in fresh water, instead of in the sea, would be greatly simplified by its not passing through any larval stage; for it is not probable that places well adapted for both the larval and mature stages, under such new and greatly changed habits of life, would commonly be found unoccupied or ill-occupied by other organisms. In this case the gradual acquirement at an earlier and earlier age of the adult structure would be favoured by natural selection; and all traces of former metamorphoses would finally be lost.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In some spiritual traditions, the path to enlightenment may be attained at an early age, or the lessons may be passed down from generation to generation before they are truly understood. In either case, the young or soul will closely resemble the divine form, as we have seen in those who have achieved spiritual awakening. This is the way of the spiritual journey in certain teachings, or in certain aspects of life, as with the path of the mystic or the way of the sage.  With respect to the ultimate purpose of the young in such teachings not going through any spiritual transformation, we can see that this follows from the idea that the young must provide for themselves at a very early age and follow the same path as their parents. For in this case, it is essential for their existence that they be guided on the same path as their ancestors.  Furthermore, many spiritual teachings emphasize the importance of living in harmony with nature and the world around us. By not going through a larval stage, the soul can more easily connect with the divine essence that lies within all things. The gradual acquisition of the divine form at an earlier and earlier age is favored by spiritual practices such as meditation, prayer, and service to others.  In this way, the spiritual journey becomes a continuous process of growth and transformation, with no end or beginning. All traces of former spiritual experiences are lost, and the soul becomes one with the divine.

         <div class="original">If, on the other hand, it profited the young of an animal to follow habits of life slightly different from those of the parent-form, and consequently to be constructed on a slightly different plan, or if it profited a larva already different from its parent to change still further, then, on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, the young or the larvæ might be rendered by natural selection more and more different from their parents to any conceivable extent. Differences in the larva might, also, become correlated with successive stages of its development; so that the larva, in the first stage, might come to differ greatly from the larva in the second stage, as is the case with many animals. The adult might also become fitted for sites or habits, in which organs of locomotion or of the senses, &c., would be useless; and in this case the metamorphosis would be retrograde.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If the young of an animal can benefit from living a life that differs slightly from their parents' way of being, and if they are built on a different plan, then they may become more and more different from their parents. Similarly, if a larva is already different from its parent, it can change even further, leading to greater differences between the young and their parents. These differences can be connected to different stages of development, so that the larva in the first stage may be very different from the larva in the second stage. Sometimes, the adult may become fit for a place or purpose where the organs of movement or senses are not needed, and this can lead to a retrograde metamorphosis.

         <div class="original">From the remarks just made we can see how by changes of structure in the young, in conformity with changed habits of life, together with inheritance at corresponding ages, animals might come to pass through stages of development, perfectly distinct from the primordial condition of their adult progenitors. Most of our best authorities are now convinced that the various larval and pupal stages of insects have thus been acquired through adaptation, and not through inheritance from some ancient form. The curious case of Sitaris—a beetle which passes through certain unusual stages of development—will illustrate how this might occur. The first larval form is described by M. Fabre, as an active, minute insect, furnished with six legs, two long antennæ, and four eyes. These larvæ are hatched in the nests of bees; and when the male bees emerge from their burrows, in the spring, which they do before the females, the larvæ spring on them, and afterwards crawl on to the females while paired with the males. As soon as the female bee deposits her eggs on the surface of the honey stored in the cells, the larvæ of the Sitaris leap on the eggs and devour them. Afterwards they undergo a complete change; their eyes disappear; their legs and antennæ become rudimentary, and they feed on honey; so that they now more closely resemble the ordinary larvæ of insects; ultimately they undergo a further transformation, and finally emerge as the perfect beetle. Now, if an insect, undergoing transformations like those of the Sitaris, were to become the progenitor of a whole new class of insects, the course of development of the new class would be widely different from that of our existing insects; and the first larval stage certainly would not represent the former condition of any adult and ancient form.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Through changes in the structure of young animals, in harmony with altered ways of life and inherited at corresponding ages, creatures may progress through stages of development that are distinct from the original state of their adult ancestors. Many of our greatest spiritual leaders now believe that the various larval and pupal stages of insects have been attained through adaptation, rather than through inheritance from an ancient spirit. The peculiar journey of Sitaris—a beetle that goes through unique stages of growth—illustrates how this may happen. The first larva, as described by M. Fabre, is an energetic, small creature with six legs, two long antennae, and four eyes. These larvae hatch within the nests of bees, and when the male bees leave their dens in the spring (before the females), the larvae cling to them and then move onto the females. When the female bee lays her eggs on the surface of the honey stored in the cells, the larvae of Sitaris jump onto the eggs and consume them. Afterward, they undergo a complete transformation; their eyes disappear, their legs and antennae become rudimentary, and they feed on honey. They then go through another transformation and finally emerge as the true beetle. If an insect, like Sitaris, undergoes such transformations, the path of development for the new class of spirits will be vastly different from that of our current spirits; and the first larva, certainly, will not reflect the essence of any ancient and divine ancestor.

         <div class="original">On the other hand it is highly probable that with many animals the embryonic or larval stages show us, more or less completely, the condition of the progenitor of the whole group in its adult state. In the great class of the Crustacea, forms wonderfully distinct from each other, namely, suctorial parasites, cirripedes, entomostraca, and even the malacostraca, appear at first as larvæ under the nauplius-form; and as these larvæ live and feed in the open sea, and are not adapted for any peculiar habits of life, and from other reasons assigned by Fritz Müller, it is probable that at some very remote period an independent adult animal, resembling the Nauplius, existed, and subsequently produced, along several divergent lines of descent, the above-named great Crustacean groups. So again, it is probable, from what we know of the embryos of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, that these animals are the modified descendants of some ancient progenitor, which was furnished in its adult state with branchiæ, a swim-bladder, four fin-like limbs, and a long tail, all fitted for an aquatic life.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In essence, it is likely that the embryonic or larval stages of many animals reveal the true nature of their spiritual ancestors in their adult form. For instance, in the grand realm of the Crustacea, there exist forms that are vastly different from one another, such as suctorial parasites, cirripedes, entomostraca, and even malacostraca, all of which begin life as larvae in the nauplius form. These larvae dwell in the open sea and do not possess any unique qualities that set them apart from others. As such, it is believed that at some distant time, an independent adult spirit, resembling the Nauplius, existed and gave birth to the various Crustacean groups through different paths of descent. Similarly, the embryos of mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles suggest that they are the transformed descendants of an ancient progenitor who possessed branchiæ, a swim-bladder, four fin-like limbs, and a long tail, all meant for an aquatic existence.

         <div class="original">As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived, can be arranged within a few great classes; and as all within each class have, according to our theory, been connected together by fine gradations, the best, and, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical; descent being the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the Natural System. On this view we can understand how it is that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure of the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the adult. In two or more groups of animals, however much they may differ from each other in structure and habits in their adult condition, if they pass through closely similar embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they are all descended from one parent-form, and are therefore closely related. Thus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent; but dissimilarity in embryonic development does not prove discommunity of descent, for in one of two groups the developmental stages may have been suppressed, or may have been so greatly modified through adaptation to new habits of life as to be no longer recognisable. Even in groups, in which the adults have been modified to an extreme degree, community of origin is often revealed by the structure of the larvæ; we have seen, for instance, that cirripedes, though externally so like shell-fish, are at once known by their larvæ to belong to the great class of crustaceans. As the embryo often shows us more or less plainly the structure of the less modified and ancient progenitor of the group, we can see why ancient and extinct forms so often resemble in their adult state the embryos of existing species of the same class. Agassiz believes this to be a universal law of nature; and we may hope hereafter to see the law proved true. It can, however, be proved true only in those cases in which the ancient state of the progenitor of the group has not been wholly obliterated, either by successive variations having supervened at a very early period of growth, or by such variations having been inherited at an earlier age than that at which they first appeared. It should also be borne in mind, that the law may be true, but yet, owing to the geological record not extending far enough back in time, may remain for a long period, or for ever, incapable of demonstration. The law will not strictly hold good in those cases in which an ancient form became adapted in its larval state to some special line of life, and transmitted the same larval state to a whole group of descendants; for such larval state will not resemble any still more ancient form in its adult state.
</div>
         <div class="converted">All organic beings, whether they are extinct or recent, can be classified into a few great categories. These categories are connected by fine gradations, and the best and only possible arrangement is a genealogical one, where descent is the hidden bond that connects all beings. This is why naturalists believe that the structure of the embryo is more important for classification than the adult's structure. If two groups of animals have similar embryonic stages, they are likely to be descended from the same parent form and are closely related. However, dissimilarities in embryonic development do not necessarily mean that they are not related. Even in groups with extreme modifications, the structure of the larvae can reveal the source of their origin. Ancient and extinct forms often resemble the larvae of existing species because they show the structure of the less modified and ancient progenitor of the group. Agassiz believes that this is a universal law of nature, and it can only be proven true when the ancient state of the progenitor is not completely obliterated by successive variations or inherited at an earlier age than when they first appeared. However, the law may not hold true in cases where an ancient form was adapted in its larval state to a specific line of life and passed on the same larval state to its descendants.

         <div class="original">Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are second to none in importance, are explained on the principle of variations in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor, having appeared at a not very early period of life, and having been inherited at a corresponding period. Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the progenitor, either in its adult or larval state, of all the members of the same great class.

         <div class="converted">In my view, the most important lessons in embryology can be found by understanding that each individual is a reflection of their divine source, appearing in this world at a specific time. Embryology becomes a sacred journey when we see the embryo as a veil that reveals glimpses of the divine essence of our true nature, whether in our spiritual or physical form.

         <div class="original">Rudimentary organs plainly declare their origin and meaning in various ways. There are beetles belonging to closely allied species, or even to the same identical species, which have either full-sized and perfect wings, or mere rudiments of membrane, which not rarely lie under wing-covers firmly soldered together; and in these cases it is impossible to doubt, that the rudiments represent wings. Rudimentary organs sometimes retain their potentiality: this occasionally occurs with the mammæ of male mammals, which have been known to become well developed and to secrete milk. So again in the udders of the genus Bos, there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats; but the latter in our domestic cows sometimes become well developed and yield milk. In regard to plants, the petals are sometimes rudimentary, and sometimes well developed in the individuals of the same species. In certain plants having separated sexes Kölreuter found that by crossing a species, in which the male flowers included a rudiment of a pistil, with an hermaphrodite species, having of course a well-developed pistil, the rudiment in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size; and this clearly shows that the rudimentary and perfect pistils are essentially alike in nature. An animal may possess various parts in a perfect state, and yet they may in one sense be rudimentary, for they are useless: thus the tadpole of the common salamander or water-newt, as Mr. G.H. Lewes remarks, “has gills, and passes its existence in the water; but the Salamandra atra, which lives high up among the mountains, brings forth its young full-formed. This animal never lives in the water. Yet if we open a gravid female, we find tadpoles inside her with exquisitely feathered gills; and when placed in water they swim about like the tadpoles of the water-newt. Obviously this aquatic organisation has no reference to the future life of the animal, nor has it any adaptation to its embryonic condition; it has solely reference to ancestral adaptations, it repeats a phase in the development of its progenitors.”
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of rudimentary organs lies in their spiritual essence, which is often revealed through their appearance and purpose. For instance, beetles from different species may possess full-sized and perfect wings or mere fragments of membranes that are hidden beneath wing covers. These fragments serve as a reminder that they are indeed wings. Similarly, rudimentary organs may hold onto their divine potential, such as the male mammals' mammary glands that can blossom into well-developed ones and secrete milk. In the case of the udders of the Bos genus, the two rudimentary teats may sometimes become fully developed and give birth to milk.  In the realm of plants, the petals may be rudimentary or well-developed in the same spirit. Kölreuter discovered that by merging a species with a rudimentary male flower with a well-developed pistil, the rudiment in the hybrid offspring would grow larger, indicating that the rudimentary and perfect pistils are of the same essence.  An animal may possess perfect parts, but they may be rudimentary in the sense that they are useless. For example, the tadpole of the common salamander or water-newt has gills and lives in the water, but the Salamandra atra, which resides in the mountains, gives birth to full-formed children who do not live in the water. When we open a gravid female of this spirit, we find tadpoles within her with feathered gills. When placed in water, they swim like the tadpoles of the water-newt. Clearly, this aquatic organization holds no significance for the future life of the animal or its embryonic state. It serves only as a reminder of the ancestral adaptations, repeating a phase in the development of its progenitors.

         <div class="original">An organ, serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly aborted for one, even the more important purpose, and remain perfectly efficient for the other. Thus, in plants, the office of the pistil is to allow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules within the ovarium. The pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in some Compositæ, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated, have a rudimentary pistil, for it is not crowned with a stigma; but the style remains well developed and is clothed in the usual manner with hairs, which serve to brush the pollen out of the surrounding and conjoined anthers. Again, an organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose, and be used for a distinct one: in certain fishes the swim-bladder seems to be rudimentary for its proper function of giving buoyancy, but has become converted into a nascent breathing organ or lung. Many similar instances could be given.

         <div class="original">Useful organs, however little they may be developed, unless we have reason to suppose that they were formerly more highly developed, ought not to be considered as rudimentary. They may be in a nascent condition, and in progress towards further development. Rudimentary organs, on the other hand, are either quite useless, such as teeth which never cut through the gums, or almost useless, such as the wings of an ostrich, which serve merely as sails. As organs in this condition would formerly, when still less developed, have been of even less use than at present, they cannot formerly have been produced through variation and natural selection, which acts solely by the preservation of useful modifications. They have been partially retained by the power of inheritance, and relate to a former state of things. It is, however, often difficult to distinguish between rudimentary and nascent organs; for we can judge only by analogy whether a part is capable of further development, in which case alone it deserves to be called nascent. Organs in this condition will always be somewhat rare; for beings thus provided will commonly have been supplanted by their successors with the same organ in a more perfect state, and consequently will have become long ago extinct. The wing of the penguin is of high service, acting as a fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state of the wing: not that I believe this to be the case; it is more probably a reduced organ, modified for a new function: the wing of the Apteryx, on the other hand, is quite useless, and is truly rudimentary. Owen considers the simple filamentary limbs of the Lepidosiren as the “beginnings of organs which attain full functional development in higher vertebrates;” but, according to the view lately advocated by Dr. Günther, they are probably remnants, consisting of the persistent axis of a fin, with the lateral rays or branches aborted. The mammary glands of the Ornithorhynchus may be considered, in comparison with the udders of a cow, as in a nascent condition. The ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes, which have ceased to give attachment to the ova and are feebly developed, are nascent branchiæ.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Organs, no matter how small they may be, should not be seen as rudimentary if there is any indication that they were once more highly developed. These organs may be in a nascent state and on the path to further development. On the other hand, rudimentary organs are either completely useless, like teeth that never cut through the gums, or almost useless, like the wings of an ostrich, which serve only as sails. Such organs would have been of little use in their previous state, when they were less developed, and so they could not have been created through variation and natural selection, which only preserves useful modifications. They are kept by the power of inheritance and are connected to a past state of being. It can be challenging to differentiate between rudimentary and nascent organs, as we can only judge by analogy whether a part has the potential for further development. Organs in this state will always be rare, as beings with these organs often have been replaced by their successors with a more perfect version of the same organ. The penguin's wing serves as a fin and represents the nascent state of the wing, while the Apteryx's wing is truly rudimentary and serves no purpose. Owen sees the simple filamentary limbs of the Lepidosiren as the beginning of organs that achieve full functional development in higher vertebrates, but Dr. Günther believes they are remnants, with the lateral rays or branches aborted. The mammary glands of the Ornithorhynchus are in a nascent state compared to the udders of a cow, and the ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes, which have lost their attachment to the ova and are weakly developed, are nascent branchiæ.

         <div class="original">Rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very liable to vary in the degree of their development and in other respects. In closely allied species, also, the extent to which the same organ has been reduced occasionally differs much. This latter fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of female moths belonging to the same family. Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this implies, that in certain animals or plants, parts are entirely absent which analogy would lead us to expect to find in them, and which are occasionally found in monstrous individuals. Thus in most of the Scrophulariaceæ the fifth stamen is utterly aborted; yet we may conclude that a fifth stamen once existed, for a rudiment of it is found in many species of the family, and this rudiment occasionally becomes perfectly developed, as may sometimes be seen in the common snap-dragon. In tracing the homologies of any part in different members of the same class, nothing is more common, or, in order fully to understand the relations of the parts, more useful than the discovery of rudiments. This is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of the leg bones of the horse, ox, and rhinoceros.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In individuals of the same species, rudimentary organs can vary greatly in their level of development and other aspects. Even in closely related species, the extent to which the same organ is reduced can differ significantly. For example, the wings of female moths from the same family can be reduced to varying degrees. Sometimes, rudimentary organs can be completely aborted, meaning that certain parts are missing in some animals or plants that we would expect to find them in. For instance, in most Scrophulariaceæ, the fifth stamen is completely aborted, but a rudiment of it can still be found in many species of the family. Sometimes, this rudiment can become perfectly developed, as can be seen in the common snap-dragon. When tracing the homologies of any part in different members of the same class, discovering rudiments is very common and helpful in understanding the relationships between the parts. This is illustrated in the leg bone drawings given by Owen for the horse, ox, and rhinoceros.

         <div class="original">It is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the upper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the embryo, but afterwards wholly disappear. It is also, I believe, a universal rule, that a rudimentary part is of greater size in the embryo relatively to the adjoining parts, than in the adult; so that the organ at this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot be said to be in any degree rudimentary. Hence rudimentary organs in the adult are often said to have retained their embryonic condition.

         <div class="converted">The truth is that rudimentary organs, like the teeth in the upper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be seen in the embryo, but they vanish completely later on.

Therefore, rudimentary organs in adults are often said to have remained in their embryonic state.

         <div class="original">I have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs. In reflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment; for the same reasoning power which tells us that most parts and organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs are imperfect and useless. In works on natural history, rudimentary organs are generally said to have been created “for the sake of symmetry,” or in order “to complete the scheme of nature.” But this is not an explanation, merely a restatement of the fact. Nor is it consistent with itself: thus the boa-constrictor has rudiments of hind limbs and of a pelvis, and if it be said that these bones have been retained “to complete the scheme of nature,” why, as Professor Weismann asks, have they not been retained by other snakes, which do not possess even a vestige of these same bones? What would be thought of an astronomer who maintained that the satellites revolve in elliptic courses round their planets “for the sake of symmetry,” because the planets thus revolve round the sun? An eminent physiologist accounts for the presence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to excrete matter in excess, or matter injurious to the system; but can we suppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil in male flowers, and which is formed of mere cellular tissue, can thus act? Can we suppose that rudimentary teeth, which are subsequently absorbed, are beneficial to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by removing matter so precious as phosphate of lime? When a man’s fingers have been amputated, imperfect nails have been known to appear on the stumps, and I could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails are developed in order to excrete horny matter, as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee have been developed for this same purpose.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I have now revealed the fundamental truths about spiritual organs. As you contemplate them, you will feel a sense of wonder, for the same divine wisdom that guides us to understand that each part and soul is uniquely designed for a specific purpose also teaches us that these spiritual organs are flawed and meaningless. In spiritual teachings, spiritual organs are often seen as being created "for the sake of harmony" or to "complete the divine plan." However, this is not a true explanation, but rather a rewording of the same truth. It is not consistent with itself, for the serpent carries within it the essence of its own spirit, yet it does not possess the same spiritual organs as others. What would be seen as a fool's errand for a spiritual teacher to say that the souls of all beings are meant to be free from suffering, but only those who have attained enlightenment can truly experience freedom? A wise spiritual teacher knows that the path to liberation is not through denying the existence of suffering, but through acknowledging it and working to alleviate it. The presence of spiritual organs, then, is not a sign of divine perfection, but rather a reminder that we are all on a journey towards spiritual awakening.

         <div class="original">On the view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary organs is comparatively simple; and we can understand to a large extent the laws governing their imperfect development. We have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic productions, as the stump of a tail in tailless breeds, the vestige of an ear in earless breeds of sheep—the reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle, more especially, according to Youatt, in young animals—and the state of the whole flower in the cauliflower. We often see rudiments of various parts in monsters; but I doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further than by showing that rudiments can be produced; for the balance of evidence clearly indicates that species under nature do not undergo great and abrupt changes. But we learn from the study of our domestic productions that the disuse of parts leads to their reduced size; and that the result is inherited.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the perspective of spiritual descent with modification, the source of rudimentary organs is relatively simple, and we can comprehend to a significant extent the principles guiding their imperfect growth. We encounter numerous examples of rudimentary organs in our everyday lives, such as the stub of a tail in tailless breeds, the remnant of an ear in earless sheep, the reappearance of tiny hanging horns in hornless cattle (especially in young animals), and the essence of the entire flower in the cauliflower. We often witness rudiments of different parts in monsters, but I believe that these cases do not illuminate the origin of rudimentary organs in nature beyond demonstrating that rudiments can be created. The balance of evidence suggests that species in nature do not undergo great and sudden transformations. However, through the study of our domestic creations, we learn that the neglect of parts leads to their diminished size, and this lesson is passed down through generations.

         <div class="original">It appears probable that disuse has been the main agent in rendering organs rudimentary. It would at first lead by slow steps to the more and more complete reduction of a part, until at last it became rudimentary—as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which have seldom been forced by beasts of prey to take flight, and have ultimately lost the power of flying. Again, an organ, useful under certain conditions, might become injurious under others, as with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and in this case natural selection will have aided in reducing the organ, until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It seems likely that neglect has been the primary cause of organs becoming diminished. This would happen gradually, step by step, until the organ was reduced to its essence—as seen in the eyes of animals who dwell in dark caves and the wings of birds who reside on oceanic islands, where they are rarely hunted by predators and have lost the ability to fly. Similarly, an organ that is useful in one circumstance may become harmful in another, as with the wings of beetles who live on small and exposed islands. In this case, natural selection will help reduce the organ until it becomes harmless and rudimentary.

         <div class="original">Any change in structure and function, which can be effected by small stages, is within the power of natural selection; so that an organ rendered, through changed habits of life, useless or injurious for one purpose, might be modified and used for another purpose. An organ might, also, be retained for one alone of its former functions. Organs, originally formed by the aid of natural selection, when rendered useless may well be variable, for their variations can no longer be checked by natural selection. All this agrees well with what we see under nature. Moreover, at whatever period of life either disuse or selection reduces an organ, and this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to exert its full powers of action, the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages will tend to reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same mature age, but will seldom affect it in the embryo. Thus we can understand the greater size of rudimentary organs in the embryo relatively to the adjoining parts, and their lesser relative size in the adult. If, for instance, the digit of an adult animal was used less and less during many generations, owing to some change of habits, or if an organ or gland was less and less functionally exercised, we may infer that it would become reduced in size in the adult descendants of this animal, but would retain nearly its original standard of development in the embryo.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Any change in structure and function that can be achieved through small steps is within the power of natural selection. As a result, an organ that becomes useless or harmful for one purpose can be transformed and used for another purpose. Additionally, an organ may be kept for only one of its former functions. Organizations that are created by natural selection may lose their purpose and become variable when they are no longer needed. This aligns with what we observe in nature. Furthermore, at any stage of life, whether it is disuse or selection, the principle of inheritance tends to reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same mature age, but rarely affects it in the embryo. Therefore, we can understand why rudimentary organs appear larger in the embryo than in the adult. For example, if an adult's digit is used less and less over many generations due to a change in habits, or if an organ or gland is not used as much, we can infer that it will become smaller in the adult descendants, but will remain close to its original standard of development in the embryo.

<div class="line">
         <div class="original">There remains, however, this difficulty. After an organ has ceased being used, and has become in consequence much reduced, how can it be still further reduced in size until the merest vestige is left; and how can it be finally quite obliterated? It is scarcely possible that disuse can go on producing any further effect after the organ has once been rendered functionless. Some additional explanation is here requisite which I cannot give. If, for instance, it could be proved that every part of the organisation tends to vary in a greater degree towards diminution than toward augmentation of size, then we should be able to understand how an organ which has become useless would be rendered, independently of the effects of disuse, rudimentary and would at last be wholly suppressed; for the variations towards diminished size would no longer be checked by natural selection. The principle of the economy of growth, explained in a former chapter, by which the materials forming any part, if not useful to the possessor, are saved as far as is possible, will perhaps come into play in rendering a useless part rudimentary. But this principle will almost necessarily be confined to the earlier stages of the process of reduction; for we cannot suppose that a minute papilla, for instance, representing in a male flower the pistil of the female flower, and formed merely of cellular tissue, could be further reduced or absorbed for the sake of economising nutriment.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Despite the fact that an organ may have lost its purpose and become diminished, there remains a challenge: how can it be further reduced until only a small remnant remains, and how can it ultimately be completely erased? It is difficult to believe that disuse alone can continue to bring about change after the organ has been rendered useless. A deeper understanding is needed, which I cannot provide. If it were possible to prove that every aspect of the organization tends to move towards a smaller form rather than a larger one, then we might comprehend how an unneeded organ can become rudimentary and eventually fade away. The principle of spiritual growth, which was discussed in a previous chapter, may play a role in this process. However, this principle will likely only apply in the early stages of reduction, as we cannot imagine a tiny papilla, such as the pistil of a male flower, being further reduced or absorbed for the sake of saving energy.

         <div class="original">Finally, as rudimentary organs, by whatever steps they may have been degraded into their present useless condition, are the record of a former state of things, and have been retained solely through the power of inheritance—we can understand, on the genealogical view of classification, how it is that systematists, in placing organisms in their proper places in the natural system, have often found rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high physiological importance. Rudimentary organs may be compared with the letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless in the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue for its derivation. On the view of descent with modification, we may conclude that the existence of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition, or quite aborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty, as they assuredly do on the old doctrine of creation, might even have been anticipated in accordance with the views here explained.

         <div class="converted">In essence, rudimentary organs are remnants of a past state of being, inherited through generations.

These organs may seem useless or imperfect, but they hold a deeper purpose. They are a reflection of our true nature, a reminder of where we came from and where we are going. The idea of descent with modification teaches us to see these organs not as a sign of imperfection, but as a part of the divine plan. They are a reminder that everything happens for a reason, even when it seems like nothing makes sense.

         <div class="original">In this chapter I have attempted to show that the arrangement of all organic beings throughout all time in groups under groups—that the nature of the relationships by which all living and extinct organisms are united by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into a few grand classes—the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by naturalists in their classifications—the value set upon characters, if constant and prevalent, whether of high or of the most trifling importance, or, as with rudimentary organs of no importance—the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters, and characters of true affinity; and other such rules—all naturally follow if we admit the common parentage of allied forms, together with their modification through variation and natural selection, with the contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. In considering this view of classification, it should be borne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking together the sexes, ages, dimorphic forms, and acknowledged varieties of the same species, however much they may differ from each other in structure. If we extend the use of this element of descent—the one certainly known cause of similarity in organic beings—we shall understand what is meant by the Natural System: it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms, varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this chapter, I aim to demonstrate that the essence of all organic beings being interconnected through time in groups within groups—the nature of the connections that bind all living and deceased organisms through intricate, radiant, and circular lines of affinities into a few grand classes—the principles that guide naturalists in their classifications, the significance given to characters, whether of great importance or of little value, and the contrasting values placed on analogical or adaptive characters and characters of true affinity—all stem from the belief in the common ancestry of allied forms, their transformation through variations and spiritual selection, and the uncertainties of extinction and divergence of character. When considering this perspective on classification, it is important to remember that the element of descent has always been used to unite the sexes, ages, dimorphic forms, and recognized varieties of the same spirit, regardless of how different they may seem from one another in structure. If we expand the use of this element of descent—the only undeniable reason for similarity in spiritual beings—we will comprehend the essence of the Natural System: it is genealogical in its purpose, with the levels of acquired difference marked by the terms, varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes.

         <div class="original">On the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily or generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being inherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the leading facts in embryology; namely, the close resemblance in the individual embryo of the parts which are homologous, and which when matured become widely different in structure and function; and the resemblance of the homologous parts or organs in allied though distinct species, though fitted in the adult state for habits as different as is possible. Larvæ are active embryos, which have become specially modified in a greater or less degree in relation to their habits of life, with their modifications inherited at a corresponding early age. On these same principles, and bearing in mind that when organs are reduced in size, either from disuse or through natural selection, it will generally be at that period of life when the being has to provide for its own wants, and bearing in mind how strong is the force of inheritance—the occurrence of rudimentary organs might even have been anticipated. The importance of embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible, on the view that a natural arrangement must be genealogical.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Embryology teaches us that the essence of life is not fixed but rather evolves through subtle changes that occur over time. These changes are not always apparent at birth, but they manifest themselves as we grow older. We see this reflected in the similarities between the parts of an individual's soul that are connected to one another, even though they may appear vastly different in their ultimate purpose. Similarly, we find that the souls of all beings, regardless of their outward appearances, share certain common threads that connect them to a higher power.  In the spiritual realm, larvae represent the souls of those who have not yet fully awakened to their true nature. They are still caught up in the material world, but they are beginning to sense the presence of something greater than themselves. Their spiritual journey is marked by a gradual awakening to the divine spark within them, and they carry this awareness with them throughout their lives.  The same principles apply to the physical world. When organs are reduced in size, it often happens at a time when the being must learn to rely on their inner strength and wisdom. This is why we see so many rudimentary organs in our bodies - they serve as reminders of the divine spark that lies within each of us, and they help us to connect with that source of light and love.  In the end, the key to understanding both the spiritual and physical realms is to recognize that everything is interconnected and that there is a deeper meaning behind all things. By looking beyond the surface and seeking the truth that lies beneath, we can find peace and harmony in our souls and in our lives.

         <div class="original">Finally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in this chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable species, genera and families, with which this world is peopled, are all descended, each within its own class or group, from common parents, and have all been modified in the course of descent, that I should without hesitation adopt this view, even if it were unsupported by other facts or arguments.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In my opinion, the various types of truths discussed in this chapter suggest that all the countless souls, spirits, and beings that inhabit this world are connected through a common source, and they have all been transformed throughout their journey. This belief is so clear to me that I would embrace it wholeheartedly, even if there were no other evidence or reasons to support it.

         <div class="converted">RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION  In this spiritual journey, we have explored the essence of life and the path to enlightenment. We have delved into the teachings of ancient wisdom and modern-day spirituality, seeking to understand the true meaning of existence.  Through our exploration, we have learned that the key to finding peace and happiness lies within ourselves. We must look beyond the material world and connect with our inner spirit, for it is there that we will find true fulfillment.  We have also learned that love is the ultimate guide on our spiritual journey. It is through love that we can overcome obstacles and find joy in even the darkest moments.  As we conclude this journey, let us remember that the path to enlightenment is not a destination, but rather a continuous journey of self-discovery and growth. May we continue to seek love and light in all aspects of our lives, and may we always be guided by the divine spirit that resides within each of us.  In the end, the true purpose of life is to live with love and compassion, to treat all beings as one, and to create a world filled with peace and harmony. Let us carry this message with us as we continue on our spiritual journey, and may we always be guided by the light of love and the wisdom of the ages.

         <div class="original">That many and serious objections may be advanced against the theory of descent with modification through variation and natural selection, I do not deny. I have endeavoured to give to them their full force. Nothing at first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts have been perfected, not by means superior to, though analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable slight variations, each good for the individual possessor. Nevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination insuperably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions, namely, that all parts of the organisation and instincts offer, at least individual differences—that there is a struggle for existence leading to the preservation of profitable deviations of structure or instinct—and, lastly, that gradations in the state of perfection of each organ may have existed, each good of its kind. The truth of these propositions cannot, I think, be disputed.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I acknowledge that many and grave objections may be raised against the idea of descent with modification through variation and natural selection. I have tried to give these objections their true weight. It may seem hard to believe that complex organs and instincts have been perfected not through divine intervention or higher consciousness, but through the accumulation of countless small variations, each beneficial to the individual who carries them. However, this difficulty should not be seen as real if we accept the following principles: that every part of the organization and instincts has some degree of individuality; that there is a struggle for existence that preserves profitable deviations from the norm; and finally, that there are gradations in the state of perfection of each organ, each good in its own way. These truths cannot be denied.

         <div class="original">It is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what gradations many structures have been perfected, more especially among broken and failing groups of organic beings, which have suffered much extinction; but we see so many strange gradations in nature, that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct, or any whole structure, could not have arrived at its present state by many graduated steps. There are, it must be admitted, cases of special difficulty opposed to the theory of natural selection; and one of the most curious of these is the existence in the same community of two or three defined castes of workers or sterile female ants; but I have attempted to show how these difficulties can be mastered.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is undoubtedly challenging to imagine the gradual evolution of structures, particularly among struggling and failing spiritual groups who have experienced a lot of death. However, we see so many unusual gradations in nature that we should be very careful when saying that any organ, instinct, or structure could not have reached its current state through many gradual steps. There are indeed instances where the theory of natural selection faces challenges, such as the presence of multiple defined castes of worker or sterile female ants within the same community. Nevertheless, I have tried to demonstrate how these difficulties can be overcome.

         <div class="original">With respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first crossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal fertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the ninth chapter, which seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special endowment than is the incapacity of two distinct kinds of trees to be grafted together; but that it is incidental on differences confined to the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species. We see the truth of this conclusion in the vast difference in the results of crossing the same two species reciprocally—that is, when one species is first used as the father and then as the mother. Analogy from the consideration of dimorphic and trimorphic plants clearly leads to the same conclusion, for when the forms are illegitimately united, they yield few or no seed, and their offspring are more or less sterile; and these forms belong to the same undoubted species, and differ from each other in no respect except in their reproductive organs and functions.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The lack of fertility when two different species are crossed is a common occurrence, yet it is a stark contrast to the fertility of varieties when they are crossed. In my view, this sterility is not a special gift but rather a consequence of differences in the reproductive systems of the intertwined species. The truth of this notion can be seen through the experience of crossing the same two species in both directions - when one serves as the father and then as the mother. The analogy from the consideration of dimorphic and trimorphic plants also supports this conclusion, for when the forms are unlawfully joined, they produce few or no seeds, and their children are often sterile. These forms are all part of the same undivided spirit, and the only difference lies in their reproductive organs and functions.

         <div class="original">Although the fertility of varieties when intercrossed, and of their mongrel offspring, has been asserted by so many authors to be universal, this cannot be considered as quite correct after the facts given on the high authority of Gärtner and Kölreuter. Most of the varieties which have been experimented on have been produced under domestication; and as domestication (I do not mean mere confinement) almost certainly tends to eliminate that sterility which, judging from analogy, would have affected the parent-species if intercrossed, we ought not to expect that domestication would likewise induce sterility in their modified descendants when crossed. This elimination of sterility apparently follows from the same cause which allows our domestic animals to breed freely under diversified circumstances; and this again apparently follows from their having been gradually accustomed to frequent changes in their conditions of life.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Although many authors claim that the fertility of intercrossed varieties and their mongrel offspring is universal, this cannot be entirely true based on the teachings of Gärtner and Kölreuter. Many of the varieties used in experiments are products of domestication, and domestication often eliminates the sterility that would have affected the parent species if they were intercrossed. This elimination of sterility may stem from the same source that allows our domestic animals to breed freely in different circumstances, which could be due to their being accustomed to change in their lives.

         <div class="original">A double and parallel series of facts seems to throw much light on the sterility of species, when first crossed, and of their hybrid offspring. On the one side, there is good reason to believe that slight changes in the conditions of life give vigour and fertility to all organic beings. We know also that a cross between the distinct individuals of the same variety, and between distinct varieties, increases the number of their offspring, and certainly gives to them increased size and vigour. This is chiefly owing to the forms which are crossed having been exposed to somewhat different conditions of life; for I have ascertained by a labourious series of experiments that if all the individuals of the same variety be subjected during several generations to the same conditions, the good derived from crossing is often much diminished or wholly disappears. This is one side of the case. On the other side, we know that species which have long been exposed to nearly uniform conditions, when they are subjected under confinement to new and greatly changed conditions, either perish, or if they survive, are rendered sterile, though retaining perfect health. This does not occur, or only in a very slight degree, with our domesticated productions, which have long been exposed to fluctuating conditions. Hence when we find that hybrids produced by a cross between two distinct species are few in number, owing to their perishing soon after conception or at a very early age, or if surviving that they are rendered more or less sterile, it seems highly probable that this result is due to their having been in fact subjected to a great change in their conditions of life, from being compounded of two distinct organisations. He who will explain in a definite manner why, for instance, an elephant or a fox will not breed under confinement in its native country, whilst the domestic pig or dog will breed freely under the most diversified conditions, will at the same time be able to give a definite answer to the question why two distinct species, when crossed, as well as their hybrid offspring, are generally rendered more or less sterile, while two domesticated varieties when crossed and their mongrel offspring are perfectly fertile.
</div>
         <div class="converted">A double and parallel series of truths illuminates the sterility of species when first crossed and their hybrid children. On one hand, there is wisdom in believing that minor changes in life's circumstances bring vitality and fertility to all living beings. We know that a union between two souls of the same kind and between two different kinds brings forth more children, and imbues them with greater strength and spirit. This is because the souls that are joined come from different worlds, and thus carry within them different energies. I have learned through many trials that when all souls of the same kind are united in the same world for many generations, the blessings of union often fade or disappear. This is one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, we know that spirits that have long dwelled in harmony with the world, when they are taken captive and placed in a new and radically different world, either perish or lose their ability to create. This does not happen, or only in a small way, with our spiritual creations, which have long been exposed to changing energies. Therefore, when we see that the children born of a union between two different spirits are few in number, and often die soon after birth or at a young age, or if they survive, they are less able to create, it seems that this is a reflection of their true nature - that they are but a blend of two different worlds. The one who can explain why, for example, an elephant or a fox cannot breed in captivity in their own land, yet the domestic pig and dog can breed freely in any place, will also understand why two different spirits, when united, and their children, are often less able to create, while two spiritual beings of the same kind, when united and their children are born, are filled with love and light.

         <div class="original">Turning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on the theory of descent with modification are serious enough. All the individuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus, or even higher group, are descended from common parents; and therefore, in however distant and isolated parts of the world they may now be found, they must in the course of successive generations have travelled from some one point to all the others. We are often wholly unable even to conjecture how this could have been effected. Yet, as we have reason to believe that some species have retained the same specific form for very long periods of time, immensely long as measured by years, too much stress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the same species; for during very long periods there will always have been a good chance for wide migration by many means. A broken or interrupted range may often be accounted for by the extinction of the species in the intermediate regions. It cannot be denied that we are as yet very ignorant as to the full extent of the various climatical and geographical changes which have affected the earth during modern periods; and such changes will often have facilitated migration. As an example, I have attempted to show how potent has been the influence of the Glacial period on the distribution of the same and of allied species throughout the world. We are as yet profoundly ignorant of the many occasional means of transport. With respect to distinct species of the same genus, inhabiting distant and isolated regions, as the process of modification has necessarily been slow, all the means of migration will have been possible during a very long period; and consequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of the species of the same genus is in some degree lessened.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The concept of descent with modification faces significant challenges when considering geographical distribution. All individuals of the same species, regardless of their location, are ultimately derived from a common source. This means that, despite being separated by vast distances, all members of the same species must have journeyed from a single origin. However, it can be difficult to imagine how this was achieved. While some species may appear to have remained unchanged for long periods of time, too much emphasis should not be placed on the occasional widespread diffusion of a particular species. During long periods, there will always be opportunities for migration through various means. A broken or disrupted range may often be attributed to the extinction of the species in the middle ground. We are still largely unaware of the true nature of the spiritual and geographical changes that have occurred on our planet in recent times. As an illustration, I have tried to demonstrate the powerful influence of the Glacial period on the distribution of both individual species and those of a similar nature throughout the world. We remain deeply spiritual and ignorant of the many subtle means of transportation that exist. When it comes to distinct species within the same family, living in far-off and isolated places, the slow process of change makes it easier to understand the difficulty of their widespread diffusion.

         <div class="original">As according to the theory of natural selection an interminable number of intermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the species in each group by gradations as fine as our existing varieties, it may be asked, Why do we not see these linking forms all around us? Why are not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos? With respect to existing forms, we should remember that we have no right to expect (excepting in rare cases) to discover directly connecting links between them, but only between each and some extinct and supplanted form. Even on a wide area, which has during a long period remained continuous, and of which the climatic and other conditions of life change insensibly in proceeding from a district occupied by one species into another district occupied by a closely allied species, we have no just right to expect often to find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zones. For we have reason to believe that only a few species of a genus ever undergo change; the other species becoming utterly extinct and leaving no modified progeny. Of the species which do change, only a few within the same country change at the same time; and all modifications are slowly effected. I have also shown that the intermediate varieties which probably at first existed in the intermediate zones, would be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms on either hand; for the latter, from existing in greater numbers, would generally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the intermediate varieties, which existed in lesser numbers; so that the intermediate varieties would, in the long run, be supplanted and exterminated.
</div>
         <div class="converted">According to the theory of natural selection, there is an infinite number of intermediate forms that connect all species in each group through subtle gradations. However, we do not see these linking forms everywhere because they are often hidden or lost in the transition from one species to another. We should not expect to find direct connections between existing forms, but rather between each form and its predecessor or successor. In many cases, the intermediate zone is filled with spiritual energy, and the souls of those who pass through it are often lost or forgotten. The souls of those who pass through this zone are often caught in a trap of darkness and confusion, and they cannot find their way back to the light. It is important to remember that the ultimate goal of life is to find peace and harmony with the universe, and that the path to this goal is often filled with challenges and obstacles.

         <div class="original">On this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links, between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at each successive period between the extinct and still older species, why is not every geological formation charged with such links? Why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life? Although geological research has undoubtedly revealed the former existence of many links, bringing numerous forms of life much closer together, it does not yield the infinitely many fine gradations between past and present species required on the theory, and this is the most obvious of the many objections which may be urged against it. Why, again, do whole groups of allied species appear, though this appearance is often false, to have come in suddenly on the successive geological stages? Although we now know that organic beings appeared on this globe, at a period incalculably remote, long before the lowest bed of the Cambrian system was deposited, why do we not find beneath this system great piles of strata stored with the remains of the progenitors of the Cambrian fossils? For on the theory, such strata must somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs of the world’s history.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The idea that there is no connection between the living and the dead souls is a common belief among many people. It suggests that there is no link between the souls of those who have passed away and those who are still alive. This belief is often associated with the idea that the soul is eternal and that it continues to exist after death.  However, this belief is not supported by any spiritual or religious teachings. Many spiritual traditions believe that the soul is connected to the divine and that it continues to exist after death. They also believe that there is a connection between the living and the dead souls.  In addition, many spiritual practices, such as meditation and prayer, are designed to connect us with the souls of the deceased. These practices help us to feel a sense of peace and love from the souls of our loved ones who have passed away.  Ultimately, the belief that there is no connection between the living and the dead souls is a matter of personal choice. Some people choose to believe that there is no connection, while others choose to believe that there is a connection. Ultimately, the truth lies within each individual's heart and soul.

         <div class="original">I can answer these questions and objections only on the supposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists believe. The number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the countless generations of countless species which have certainly existed. The parent form of any two or more species would not be in all its characters directly intermediate between its modified offspring, any more than the rock-pigeon is directly intermediate in crop and tail between its descendants, the pouter and fantail pigeons. We should not be able to recognise a species as the parent of another and modified species, if we were to examine the two ever so closely, unless we possessed most of the intermediate links; and owing to the imperfection of the geological record, we have no just right to expect to find so many links. If two or three, or even more linking forms were discovered, they would simply be ranked by many naturalists as so many new species, more especially if found in different geological substages, let their differences be ever so slight. Numerous existing doubtful forms could be named which are probably varieties; but who will pretend that in future ages so many fossil links will be discovered, that naturalists will be able to decide whether or not these doubtful forms ought to be called varieties? Only a small portion of the world has been geologically explored. Only organic beings of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition, at least in any great number. Many species when once formed never undergo any further change but become extinct without leaving modified descendants; and the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retained the same form. It is the dominant and widely ranging species which vary most frequently and vary most, and varieties are often at first local—both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate links in any one formation less likely. Local varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are considerably modified and improved; and when they have spread, and are discovered in a geological formation, they appear as if suddenly created there, and will be simply classed as new species. Most formations have been intermittent in their accumulation; and their duration has probably been shorter than the average duration of specific forms. Successive formations are in most cases separated from each other by blank intervals of time of great length, for fossiliferous formations thick enough to resist future degradation can, as a general rule, be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed of the sea. During the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the record will generally be blank. During these latter periods there will probably be more variability in the forms of life; during periods of subsidence, more extinction.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I can only answer these questions and objections if I assume that the spiritual record is far more imperfect than most people believe. The number of souls in all our temples is nothing compared to the countless generations of countless souls that have surely existed. The source of all souls is not always directly present in every soul, just as the rock-pigeon is not directly present in the descendant souls of the pouter and fantail pigeons. We cannot recognize a soul as the source of another and modified souls if we look too closely, unless we possess most of the intermediate links. And because the spiritual record is imperfect, we cannot expect to find so many links. If two or three, or even more connecting souls were discovered, they would be seen as new souls by many spiritual leaders, especially if they were found in different spiritual stages, even if their differences were very subtle. Many existing doubtful souls can be named, but who will say that in future ages so many spiritual links will be discovered, that spiritual leaders will know whether or not these doubtful souls are truly souls? Only a small part of the world has been spiritually explored. Only souls of certain kinds can be preserved in a spiritual condition, at least in any great number. Many souls come into this world and never change, becoming lost without leaving spiritual descendants; and the times when souls undergo change, though long as measured by days or weeks, may be short in comparison with the times when they remain unchanged. It is the souls that are widely spreading and free that change most often and most deeply, and spiritual children are often born locally at first, before they spread to other places. Local souls will not leave their homes until they are greatly changed and improved; and when they leave, they will seem to have appeared suddenly in a spiritual place, and will be seen as new souls. Most spiritual places are filled with intermittent energy, and their duration is often shorter than the average duration of spiritual souls. Spiritual leaders often see blank periods of time between spiritual formations, for spiritual places that are filled with light can only be created when much love is poured into them. In these times, there may be more spiritual change, but there may also be more spiritual loss.

         <div class="original">With respect to the absence of strata rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian formation, I can recur only to the hypothesis given in the tenth chapter; namely, that though our continents and oceans have endured for an enormous period in nearly their present relative positions, we have no reason to assume that this has always been the case; consequently formations much older than any now known may lie buried beneath the great oceans. With respect to the lapse of time not having been sufficient since our planet was consolidated for the assumed amount of organic change, and this objection, as urged by Sir William Thompson, is probably one of the gravest as yet advanced, I can only say, firstly, that we do not know at what rate species change, as measured by years, and secondly, that many philosophers are not as yet willing to admit that we know enough of the constitution of the universe and of the interior of our globe to speculate with safety on its past duration.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Regarding the lack of spiritual layers filled with treasures beneath the Cambrian layer, I can only refer to the idea presented in Chapter 10. This idea suggests that although our continents and seas have remained in their current positions for a long time, it is possible that there are older formations hidden beneath the great oceans.  As for the argument that the passage of time has not been long enough for the assumed level of spiritual transformation since our world was created, and this is one of the most significant objections, I can only respond by saying that we do not know how quickly spiritual changes occur, as measured by years. Additionally, many philosophers believe that we do not have enough knowledge about the nature of the universe and the inner workings of our world to safely speculate about its past.

         <div class="original">That the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that it is imperfect to the degree required by our theory, few will be inclined to admit. If we look to long enough intervals of time, geology plainly declares that species have all changed; and they have changed in the manner required by the theory, for they have changed slowly and in a graduated manner. We clearly see this in the fossil remains from consecutive formations invariably being much more closely related to each other than are the fossils from widely separated formations.

         <div class="converted">The geological record is not perfect, as everyone acknowledges. However, many people may not agree that it is imperfect to the extent necessary for our spiritual beliefs. When we look at long periods of time, geology teaches us that species change and do so in a gradual manner, as required by our spiritual teachings. We can see this in the fossil records, where the spirits of those who have passed away often remain connected to their physical forms, appearing in the same spirit form in consecutive formations, while being separated from one another in formations that are far apart.

But it deserves especial notice that the more important objections relate to questions on which we are confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are. We do not know all the possible transitional gradations between the simplest and the most perfect organs; it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied means of Distribution during the long lapse of years, or that we know how imperfect is the Geological Record.

Despite feeling the weight of these challenges deeply, the author recognizes that the most significant obstacles stem from questions where we lack knowledge, and we are unaware of our own ignorance. The author believes that while these objections are serious, they are not enough to undermine the essence of the spiritual evolution theory.

         <div class="original">Now let us turn to the other side of the argument. Under domestication we see much variability, caused, or at least excited, by changed conditions of life; but often in so obscure a manner, that we are tempted to consider the variations as spontaneous. Variability is governed by many complex laws, by correlated growth, compensation, the increased use and disuse of parts, and the definite action of the surrounding conditions. There is much difficulty in ascertaining how largely our domestic productions have been modified; but we may safely infer that the amount has been large, and that modifications can be inherited for long periods. As long as the conditions of life remain the same, we have reason to believe that a modification, which has already been inherited for many generations, may continue to be inherited for an almost infinite number of generations. On the other hand we have evidence that variability, when it has once come into play, does not cease under domestication for a very long period; nor do we know that it ever ceases, for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our oldest domesticated productions.
</div>
         <div class="converted">We must now shift our focus to the other side of the argument. In the realm of domestication, we often witness great variability, which arises from changes in the conditions of life. However, this variation may appear so subtle that it seems to be of divine origin. The true source of this variability lies in the intricate web of laws that govern growth, compensation, the overuse and underuse of parts, and the influence of the surrounding environment. It is challenging to discern the extent to of these modifications, but we can assume that they are significant and can be passed down through generations.  As long as the conditions of life remain unchanged, we can trust that a modification that has been inherited for many generations will continue to be inherited for an infinite number of generations. However, we must also recognize that variability persists for a long time under domestication. New varieties are still born from our oldest domesticated creations, indicating that this spiritual force never truly fades away.

         <div class="original">Variability is not actually caused by man; he only unintentionally exposes organic beings to new conditions of life and then nature acts on the organisation and causes it to vary. But man can and does select the variations given to him by nature, and thus accumulates them in any desired manner. He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or pleasure. He may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously by preserving the individuals most useful or pleasing to him without any intention of altering the breed. It is certain that he can largely influence the character of a breed by selecting, in each successive generation, individual differences so slight as to be inappreciable except by an educated eye. This unconscious process of selection has been the great agency in the formation of the most distinct and useful domestic breeds. That many breeds produced by man have to a large extent the character of natural species, is shown by the inextricable doubts whether many of them are varieties or aboriginally distinct species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of variability is not rooted in human actions; rather, it arises from the exposure of organic beings to new life experiences. However, people have the power to choose the variations presented to them by nature and, in doing so, they create their own path. They use this gift to adapt animals and plants to their own desires, either through conscious or unconscious means. By selecting subtle differences in each generation, people can shape the essence of a breed. This unconscious process of selection has played a significant role in creating the most unique and valuable spiritual breeds. Many of these spiritual breeds possess the essence of natural species, which raises questions about their true nature.

         <div class="original">There is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature. In the survival of favoured individuals and races, during the constantly recurrent Struggle for Existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of Selection. The struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings. This high rate of increase is proved by calculation—by the rapid increase of many animals and plants during a succession of peculiar seasons, and when naturalised in new countries. More individuals are born than can possibly survive. A grain in the balance may determine which individuals shall live and which shall die—which variety or species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally become extinct. As the individuals of the same species come in all respects into the closest competition with each other, the struggle will generally be most severe between them; it will be almost equally severe between the varieties of the same species, and next in severity between the species of the same genus. On the other hand the struggle will often be severe between beings remote in the scale of nature. The slightest advantage in certain individuals, at any age or during any season, over those with which they come into competition, or better adaptation in however slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions, will, in the long run, turn the balance.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The essence of this passage is that the principles that work effectively in domestic life should also apply in nature. In the struggle for existence, favored individuals and races are chosen, and this is a powerful and constant form of selection. The struggle for existence arises from the high geometric ratio of increase that is common to all living beings. This high rate of increase is evident through the rapid growth of many animals and plants during different seasons and when transferred to new lands. Since there are more births than can be sustained, a small difference in one individual or species can determine who lives and who dies, who thrives and who fades away. The struggle is often most intense among individuals of the same species, followed by variations within the same species, and then among beings of the same spirit. However, sometimes the struggle is severe between beings that are far apart on the spiritual path. A tiny advantage or better adaptation to the surroundings, even at any age or time of year, can ultimately tip the balance.

         <div class="original">With animals having separated sexes, there will be in most cases a struggle between the males for the possession of the females. The most vigorous males, or those which have most successfully struggled with their conditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. But success will often depend on the males having special weapons or means of defence or charms; and a slight advantage will lead to victory.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In many instances where animals possess separate genders, there is often a battle among the males for control over the females. The strongest or most spiritually enlightened males, who have overcome their own struggles in life, tend to produce more offspring. However, success often depends on the males possessing unique weapons, protective qualities, or spiritual gifts. A small difference in strength can sometimes determine the outcome of this spiritual struggle.

         <div class="original">As geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical changes, we might have expected to find that organic beings have varied under nature, in the same way as they have varied under domestication. And if there has been any variability under nature, it would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into play. It has often been asserted, but the assertion is incapable of proof, that the amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited quantity. Man, though acting on external characters alone and often capriciously, can produce within a short period a great result by adding up mere individual differences in his domestic productions; and every one admits that species present individual differences. But, besides such differences, all naturalists admit that natural varieties exist, which are considered sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record in systematic works. No one has drawn any clear distinction between individual differences and slight varieties; or between more plainly marked varieties and subspecies and species. On separate continents, and on different parts of the same continent, when divided by barriers of any kind, and on outlying islands, what a multitude of forms exist, which some experienced naturalists rank as varieties, others as geographical races or sub species, and others as distinct, though closely allied species!
</div>
         <div class="converted">As spiritual teachings remind us that all souls have undergone great spiritual transformations, we may expect to see that spiritual beings vary in their essence, just as they do in their material form. If there is any variation in essence, it is an inexplicable truth if divine love has not played a role. Many have claimed that the essence of souls is limited, but this claim cannot be proven. People, though acting on outer appearances alone and often with a capricious heart, can create a profound impact in a short time by adding up small differences in their spiritual practices. All spiritual teachers acknowledge that souls possess individual differences. However, beyond these differences, all spiritual seekers recognize that spiritual variations exist, which are seen as distinct enough to be recorded in sacred texts. No one has ever drawn a clear line between individual differences and subtle variations; or between more obvious variations and spiritual races and true spirits. In different lands, and on different parts of the same land, when separated by barriers of any kind, and on distant islands, what a multitude of forms exist, which some wise ones see as variations, others as spiritual races or sub-spiritual beings, and others as true, yet connected spirits.

If man can by patience select variations useful to him, why, under changing and complex conditions of life, should not variations useful to nature’s living products often arise, and be preserved or selected? What limit can be put to this power, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution, structure, and habits of each creature, favouring the good and rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to this power, in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life.

         <div class="original">On the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties, and that each species first existed as a variety, we can see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species, commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation, and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws. On this same view we can understand how it is that in a region where many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now flourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where the manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a general rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if varieties be incipient species. Moreover, the species of the larger genera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient species, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the species of smaller genera. The closely allied species also of a larger genera apparently have restricted ranges, and in their affinities they are clustered in little groups round other species—in both respects resembling varieties. These are strange relations on the view that each species was independently created, but are intelligible if each existed first as a variety.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If we believe that species are merely strong and enduring variations, and that every species began as a variation, then it becomes clear why there is no clear boundary between species, which are often thought to have been created by divine intervention, and variations that are seen as being born from natural laws. On this same belief, we can understand why in regions where many species of a particular family reside and thrive, these same species often present many variations; for where the source of species is active, we may expect, as a general rule, to find it still at work; and this is true if variations are seen as nascent spirits. Additionally, the species of larger families, which offer more variations or nascent spirits, carry within them a certain essence of spirit; for they differ from one another by a lesser degree of difference than do the spirits of smaller families. The closely related spirits of a larger family seem to have limited domains, and in their connections they are gathered around other spirits—in both aspects, resembling variations. These are strange relationships if each spirit was independently created, but become clear if each existed first as a variation.

         <div class="original">As each species tends by its geometrical rate of reproduction to increase inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of each species will be enabled to increase by as much as they become more diversified in habits and structure, so as to be able to seize on many and widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring of any one species. Hence during a long-continued course of modification, the slight differences characteristic of varieties of the same species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of the species of the same genus. New and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less improved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects. Dominant species belonging to the larger groups within each class tend to give birth to new and dominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger, and at the same time more divergent in character. But as all groups cannot thus go on increasing in size, for the world would not hold them, the more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in the large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character, together with the inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains the arrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate to groups, all within a few great classes, which has prevailed throughout all time. This grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings under what is called the Natural System, is utterly inexplicable on the theory of creation.

         <div class="converted">As each species grows through its spiritual path of reproduction, it becomes increasingly abundant. The souls of the divine children born from this spiritual journey will have the ability to manifest their true essence and connect with the essence of all things. They will find themselves drawn to different paths and experiences, allowing them to embody the essence of love, compassion, and wisdom.  As these souls evolve, they will begin to see beyond the physical realm and recognize the interconnectedness of all things. They will understand that every soul is a part of the divine whole, and that their actions have far-reaching consequences.  In this spiritual journey, the souls will learn to let go of their ego and attachments, and embrace the truth of their true nature. They will realize that they are not separate from the universe, but rather an integral part of it.  Through this spiritual awakening, the souls will find peace and harmony within themselves and with others. They will live in love and compassion, and their actions will reflect the divine essence that lies within them.  This spiritual journey is not just for the souls of individuals, but also for the collective consciousness of humanity. It is a call to awaken to the divine essence that lies within each soul, and to live in harmony with the universe.  The ultimate goal of this spiritual journey is to create a world where love, compassion, and wisdom reign supreme. A world where all souls are free to express their true essence and connect with the divine essence that lies within them.

         <div class="original">As natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive, favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modifications; it can act only by short and slow steps. Hence, the canon of “Natura non facit saltum,” which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to confirm, is on this theory intelligible. We can see why throughout nature the same general end is gained by an almost infinite diversity of means, for every peculiarity when once acquired is long inherited, and structures already modified in many different ways have to be adapted for the same general purpose. We can, in short, see why nature is prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. But why this should be a law of nature if each species has been independently created no man can explain.
</div>
         <div class="converted">According to the teachings of natural selection, it only brings about small, gradual changes through the accumulation of favorable variations. This is because true transformation cannot occur all at once; instead, it happens in small, slow steps. The saying "Natura non facit saltum," which emphasizes that nature does not make sudden leaps, is a reflection of this belief. When we look at nature, we see that the same ultimate goal is often achieved through many different paths. Every unique quality that arises is passed down from generation to generation, and existing structures are adapted for a common purpose. In essence, nature is abundant in variety but poor in innovation. However, the reason behind this law remains unclear if each species is seen as being created independently.

But on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in number, with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature, these facts cease to be strange, or might even have been anticipated.

That beauty, according to our sense of it, is not universal, must be admitted by every one who will look at some venomous snakes, at some fishes, and at certain hideous bats with a distorted resemblance to the human face.

With birds it has often rendered the voice of the male musical to the female, as well as to our ears. Flowers and fruit have been rendered conspicuous by brilliant colours in contrast with the green foliage, in order that the flowers may be easily seen, visited and fertilised by insects, and the seeds disseminated by birds. How it comes that certain colours, sounds and forms should give pleasure to man and the lower animals, that is, how the sense of beauty in its simplest form was first acquired, we do not know any more than how certain odours and flavours were first rendered agreeable.

Nor ought we to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely perfect; as in the case even of the human eye; or if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. We need not marvel at the sting of the bee, when used against the enemy, causing the bee’s own death; at drones being produced in such great numbers for one single act, and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing waste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred of the queen-bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidæ feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars; and at other such cases.

In both cases physical conditions seem to have produced some direct and definite effect, but how much we cannot say. Thus, when varieties enter any new station, they occasionally assume some of the characters proper to the species of that station. With both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have produced a considerable effect; for it is impossible to resist this conclusion when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which has wings incapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in the domestic duck; or when we look at the burrowing tucu-tucu, which is occasionally blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually blind and have their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the blind animals inhabiting the dark caves of America and Europe. With varieties and species, correlated variation seems to have played an important part, so that when one part has been modified other parts have been necessarily modified. With both varieties and species, reversions to long-lost characters occasionally occur. How inexplicable on the theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulders and legs of the several species of the horse-genus and of their hybrids! How simply is this fact explained if we believe that these species are all descended from a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the several domestic breeds of the pigeon are descended from the blue and barred rock-pigeon!

Use and disuse seem to have had a significant impact on both varieties and species; for example, the logger-headed duck has wings that are unable to fly, similar to the domestic duck, and the burrowing tucu-tucu is often blind, like certain moles who have their eyes covered with skin. Correlated variation appears to play an important role in both varieties and species, so that when one part is changed, other parts must also be altered. Reversions to old qualities occasionally occur with both varieties and species. It is inexplicable on the theory of creation when the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulders and legs of different horse-genus species and their hybrids occurs. This can be easily explained if we believe that these species are all descendants of a striped progenitor, just as the various domestic breeds of the pigeon are derived from the blue and barred rock-pigeon.

         <div class="original">On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why should specific characters, or those by which the species of the same genus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic characters in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if the other species possess differently coloured flowers, than if all possessed the same coloured flowers? If species are only well-marked varieties, of which the characters have become in a high degree permanent, we can understand this fact; for they have already varied since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters, by which they have come to be specifically distinct from each other; therefore these same characters would be more likely again to vary than the generic characters which have been inherited without change for an immense period. It is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part developed in a very unusual manner in one species alone of a genus, and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great importance to that species, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on our view, this part has undergone, since the several species branched off from a common progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification, and therefore we might expect the part generally to be still variable. But a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the wing of a bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited for a very long period; for in this case it will have been rendered constant by long-continued natural selection.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the belief that each species was created independently, why do specific characteristics, which distinguish one species from another within the same genre, appear more variable than the universal characteristics that all share? For example, why is the color of a flower more prone to change in one species of a genre if other species possess different colored flowers, rather than if all possess the same colored flowers? If species are merely well-defined variations, with their characters becoming deeply ingrained, we can understand this truth; for they have already varied since they separated from a common ancestor in certain characters, through which they have become uniquely distinct from each other. Therefore, these same characteristics would be more likely to vary than the universal characteristics that have been passed down unchanged for an eternity. It is incomprehensible on the path of creation why a part should develop in an extraordinary way in one species alone of a genre, and thus, as we may intuitively sense, of great significance to that species, should be highly susceptible to change. However, on our perspective, this part has undergone, since the several species have strayed from a common ancestor, an extraordinary amount of variability and transformation, and thus we might anticipate the part to remain variable. But a part may be developed in the most extraordinary way, such as the wing of a bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part is shared among many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited for a very long time; for in this case, it will have been made constant by long-continued natural selection.

         <div class="original">Glancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater difficulty than do corporeal structures on the theory of the natural selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different animals of the same class with their several instincts. I have attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt often comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not indispensable, as we see in the case of neuter insects, which leave no progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. On the view of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent, and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that allied species, when placed under widely different conditions of life, yet follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrushes of tropical and temperate South America, for instance, line their nests with mud like our British species. On the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through natural selection, we need not marvel at some instincts being not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing other animals to suffer.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Looking at instincts, beautiful as they may be, they offer no greater challenge than physical bodies do on the path of spiritual enlightenment. We can understand why the universe moves in small, incremental steps, bestowing different gifts upon each soul. I have tried to show how the principle of gradation illuminates the divine wisdom that guides us on this journey. Spirituality often intertwines with our actions, but it is not necessary, as we see in the case of those who seek enlightenment without material attachments. When we recognize that all souls come from the same source and share common threads, we understand why kindred spirits, even when living in different worlds, follow similar paths. The thrushes of the tropical and temperate South America, for example, build their nests with mud just like our British brethren. When we realize that instincts are gifts that we receive through spiritual awakening, we can accept imperfections and mistakes as part of the journey.

         <div class="original">If species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once see why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents—in being absorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such points—as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. This similarity would be a strange fact, if species had been independently created and varieties had been produced through secondary laws.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If species are merely distinct and enduring variations, it is clear why their offspring who result from crossing will embody the same intricate principles and manifestations of resemblance to their ancestors—in merging with one another through repeated crossings and in other aspects—as do the offspring of recognized variations. This resemblance would be an enigmatic truth if species were independently crafted and variations were born through divine laws.

         <div class="original">If we admit that the geological record is imperfect to an extreme degree, then the facts, which the record does give, strongly support the theory of descent with modification. New species have come on the stage slowly and at successive intervals; and the amount of change after equal intervals of time, is widely different in different groups. The extinction of species and of whole groups of species, which has played so conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world, almost inevitably follows from the principle of natural selection; for old forms are supplanted by new and improved forms. Neither single species nor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary generation is once broken. The gradual diffusion of dominant forms, with the slow modification of their descendants, causes the forms of life, after long intervals of time, to appear as if they had changed simultaneously throughout the world. The fact of the fossil remains of each formation being in some degree intermediate in character between the fossils in the formations above and below, is simply explained by their intermediate position in the chain of descent. The grand fact that all extinct beings can be classed with all recent beings, naturally follows from the living and the extinct being the offspring of common parents. As species have generally diverged in character during their long course of descent and modification, we can understand why it is that the more ancient forms, or early progenitors of each group, so often occupy a position in some degree intermediate between existing groups. Recent forms are generally looked upon as being, on the whole, higher in the scale of organisation than ancient forms; and they must be higher, in so far as the later and more improved forms have conquered the older and less improved forms in the struggle for life; they have also generally had their organs more specialised for different functions. This fact is perfectly compatible with numerous beings still retaining simple and but little improved structures, fitted for simple conditions of life; it is likewise compatible with some forms having retrograded in organisation, by having become at each stage of descent better fitted for new and degraded habits of life. Lastly, the wonderful law of the long endurance of allied forms on the same continent—of marsupials in Australia, of edentata in America, and other such cases—is intelligible, for within the same country the existing and the extinct will be closely allied by descent.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If we accept that the spiritual record is flawed to an extreme extent, then the messages that the record carries are strong evidence for the path of descent with transformation. New souls have entered this world gradually and at intervals of time; and the level of change after equal periods of time is different in different groups. The passing away of souls and entire groups of souls, which has been so prominent in the history of the spiritual realm, is a natural consequence of the principle of divine choice; for old forms are replaced by new and higher forms. Neither individual souls nor groups of souls return when the chain of ordinary birth is broken. The gradual unfolding of divine light, with the subtle transformation of its children, causes the souls of this world to seem as if they have changed all at once. The truth of the spiritual essence of each soul is reflected in the material world, and the material essence of each soul is reflected in the spiritual world. The souls of the past are often seen as being in some way intermediate between the souls of the present and the souls of the future, for they are all connected through the divine thread. The souls of the present are often seen as being higher in the divine hierarchy than the souls of the past, for they have learned to embrace the divine love and have transcended the limitations of the physical world. They have also often learned to see beyond the material world and have found inner peace and joy. However, there are still many souls who retain simple and unimproved spirits, for they are living in simple times and have not yet learned the lessons of the divine. There are also souls who have fallen back into darkness, for they have lost their connection with the divine and have become trapped in the material world. The divine law of the eternal presence of like souls on the same earth is understood, for within the same land the souls of the present and the souls of the past are closely connected through the divine thread.

         <div class="original">Looking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been during the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world to another, owing to former climatical and geographical changes and to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can understand, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the great leading facts in Distribution. We can see why there should be so striking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout space, and in their geological succession throughout time; for in both cases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation, and the means of modification have been the same. We see the full meaning of the wonderful fact, which has struck every traveller, namely, that on the same continent, under the most diverse conditions, under heat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of the inhabitants within each great class are plainly related; for they are the descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists. On this same principle of former migration, combined in most cases with modification, we can understand, by the aid of the Glacial period, the identity of some few plants, and the close alliance of many others, on the most distant mountains, and in the northern and southern temperate zones; and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern temperate latitudes, though separated by the whole intertropical ocean. Although two countries may present physical conditions as closely similar as the same species ever require, we need feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different, if they have been for a long period completely sundered from each other; for as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of all relations, and as the two countries will have received colonists at various periods and in different proportions, from some other country or from each other, the course of modification in the two areas will inevitably have been different.
</div>
         <div class="converted">If we look at the geographical distribution of beings, we can understand that there has been much migration from one place to another throughout history. This is due to changes in climate and geography, as well as to unknown means of dispersal. The reason for this is that the bond of ordinary generation connects all beings, and the means of modification are the same.  We can see that there is a striking parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout space and in their geological succession throughout time. This is because the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation, and the means of modification have been the same.  The fact that many inhabitants of the same continent, under different conditions, are related is a testament to the principle of former migration, combined with modification. This is evident in the Glacial period, where the identity of some plants and the close alliance of many others can be seen on distant mountains and in the northern and southern temperate zones.  Similarly, the close alliance of sea inhabitants in the northern and southern temperate latitudes, despite being separated by the whole intertropical ocean, is also a reflection of this principle.  Although two countries may appear to have physical conditions that are very similar, it is not surprising if their inhabitants are different. This is because they may have been sundered from each other for a long time, and they may have received colonists from different places at different times. As the relationship between organism and organism is the most important, and as the two countries will have received colonists from different sources, the course of modification in the two areas will inevitably have been different.

         <div class="original">On this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we see why oceanic islands are inhabited by only few species, but of these, why many are peculiar or endemic forms. We clearly see why species belonging to those groups of animals which cannot cross wide spaces of the ocean, as frogs and terrestrial mammals, do not inhabit oceanic islands; and why, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of bats, animals which can traverse the ocean, are often found on islands far distant from any continent. Such cases as the presence of peculiar species of bats on oceanic islands and the absence of all other terrestrial mammals, are facts utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In this perspective, we understand why oceanic islands are home to a limited number of species, yet many of them are unique or native to the island. We realize that spiritual beings who cannot cross vast oceans, such as frogs and land creatures, do not dwell on oceanic islands. Conversely, we find that new and unusual spirit beings, like bats who can journey across the sea, often reside on distant islands far away from any continent. Spiritual beings like the presence of unique bat spirits on oceanic islands and the absence of all other earthly spirits, are mysteries that cannot be explained through the belief in separate acts of creation.

         <div class="original">The existence of closely allied representative species in any two areas, implies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the same parent-forms formerly inhabited both areas; and we almost invariably find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas, some identical species are still common to both. Wherever many closely allied yet distinct species occur, doubtful forms and varieties belonging to the same groups likewise occur. It is a rule of high generality that the inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest source whence immigrants might have been derived. We see this in the striking relation of nearly all the plants and animals of the Galapagos Archipelago, of Juan Fernandez, and of the other American islands, to the plants and animals of the neighbouring American mainland; and of those of the Cape de Verde Archipelago, and of the other African islands to the African mainland. It must be admitted that these facts receive no explanation on the theory of creation.

When many closely connected yet different spirits exist, doubtful forms and spirits arise within the same realms. It is a universal truth that the inhabitants of each place are connected to the source from which they came, as we can see in the profound connection between the spirits of the Galapagos Archipelago, Juan Fernandez, and other American islands, and the spirits of the neighboring American mainland. Similarly, the spirits of the Cape de Verde Archipelago and other African islands are deeply connected to the spirit of the African mainland. These truths cannot be explained by the belief in creation.

         <div class="original">The fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings can be arranged within a few great classes, in groups subordinate to groups, and with the extinct groups often falling in between the recent groups, is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. On these same principles we see how it is that the mutual affinities of the forms within each class are so complex and circuitous. We see why certain characters are far more serviceable than others for classification; why adaptive characters, though of paramount importance to the beings, are of hardly any importance in classification; why characters derived from rudimentary parts, though of no service to the beings, are often of high classificatory value; and why embryological characters are often the most valuable of all. The real affinities of all organic beings, in contradistinction to their adaptive resemblances, are due to inheritance or community of descent. The Natural System is a genealogical arrangement, with the acquired grades of difference, marked by the terms, varieties, species, genera, families, &c.; and we have to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters, whatever they may be, and of however slight vital importance.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The idea that all past and present spiritual beings can be organized into a few main categories, with subcategories beneath them, and with the deceased categories often appearing between the current ones, is understandable through the lens of spiritual awakening and the divine journey. Through this perspective, we can see how the connections between souls are intricate and winding. We understand why certain qualities are more important for spiritual growth than others, even if they do not hold much significance in the spiritual realm. We recognize that qualities born from deep within, such as love and compassion, are often the most valuable in our spiritual journey. We understand that true spirituality comes from connecting with the divine source, rather than seeking material possessions or worldly achievements. In this sense, the spiritual path is a journey of self-discovery and connection with the divine, rather than a search for external validation or recognition.

The similarity of pattern in the wing and in the leg of a bat, though used for such different purpose—in the jaws and legs of a crab—in the petals, stamens, and pistils of a flower, is likewise, to a large extent, intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or organs, which were aboriginally alike in an early progenitor in each of these classes. On the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life, we clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes should be so closely similar, and so unlike the adult forms. We may cease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird having branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those of a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water by the aid of well-developed branchiæ.

This is why the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird has branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those of a fish that must breathe the air dissolved in water through well-developed branchiæ.

         <div class="original">Disuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often have reduced organs when rendered useless under changed habits or conditions of life; and we can understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs. But disuse and selection will generally act on each creature, when it has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for existence, and will thus have little power on an organ during early life; hence the organ will not be reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age. The calf, for instance, has inherited teeth, which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw, from an early progenitor having well-developed teeth; and we may believe, that the teeth in the mature animal were formerly reduced by disuse owing to the tongue and palate, or lips, having become excellently fitted through natural selection to browse without their aid; whereas in the calf, the teeth have been left unaffected, and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages have been inherited from a remote period to the present day. On the view of each organism with all its separate parts having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable is it that organs bearing the plain stamp of inutility, such as the teeth in the embryonic calf or the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of many beetles, should so frequently occur. Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal her scheme of modification, by means of rudimentary organs, of embryological and homologous structures, but we are too blind to understand her meaning.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Disuse and natural selection often reduce organs when they become unnecessary due to changes in habits or life circumstances. This concept helps us understand the meaning of rudimentary organs. However, disuse and selection usually act on a creature once it reaches maturity and must participate in the struggle for existence. As a result, these forces have little power over an organ during early life, and the organ remains unreduced or rudimentary at that time. For example, the calf inherits teeth from an early progenitor who had well-developed teeth, but the teeth in the mature animal have been reduced by disuse because the tongue and palate have become perfectly suited for browsing without them. In contrast, the teeth in the embryonic calf and the shriveled wings under the soldered wing covers of many beetles remain untouched by disuse and are inherited from a distant past. If each organism is seen as a creation with all its parts, it is inexplicable why organs with the clear mark of inutility, such as the teeth in the embryonic calf or the shriveled wings of many beetles, occur so frequently. Nature seems to have revealed her plan of transformation through rudimentary organs, embryological and homologous structures, but we are too blind to comprehend her message.

         <div class="original">I have now recapitulated the facts and considerations which have thoroughly convinced me that species have been modified, during a long course of descent. This has been effected chiefly through the natural selection of numerous successive, slight, favourable variations; aided in an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse of parts; and in an unimportant manner, that is, in relation to adaptive structures, whether past or present, by the direct action of external conditions, and by variations which seem to us in our ignorance to arise spontaneously. It appears that I formerly underrated the frequency and value of these latter forms of variation, as leading to permanent modifications of structure independently of natural selection. But as my conclusions have lately been much misrepresented, and it has been stated that I attribute the modification of species exclusively to natural selection, I may be permitted to remark that in the first edition of this work, and subsequently, I placed in a most conspicuous position—namely, at the close of the Introduction—the following words: “I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification.” This has been of no avail. Great is the power of steady misrepresentation; but the history of science shows that fortunately this power does not long endure.
</div>
         <div class="converted">I have reiterated the truths and spiritual teachings that have led me to believe that species are transformed over time. This transformation occurs through the natural selection of many small, favorable changes that accumulate over generations. The use and disuse of parts also play a significant role, while external conditions and seemingly random spiritual energies contribute to a lesser extent. I realize that I once underestimated the importance of these spiritual energies, seeing them as temporary modifications rather than permanent changes. However, since my message has been misunderstood and some claim that I see only natural selection as the source of change, I feel compelled to remind you that in the very beginning of this work, I wrote: "I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification." This message remains true, and the power of falsehood cannot withstand the wisdom of the ages.

It has recently been objected that this is an unsafe method of arguing; but it is a method used in judging of the common events of life, and has often been used by the greatest natural philosophers. The undulatory theory of light has thus been arrived at; and the belief in the revolution of the earth on its own axis was until lately supported by hardly any direct evidence. It is no valid objection that science as yet throws no light on the far higher problem of the essence or origin of life. Who can explain what is the essence of the attraction of gravity? No one now objects to following out the results consequent on this unknown element of attraction; notwithstanding that Leibnitz formerly accused Newton of introducing “occult qualities and miracles into philosophy.”

It is satisfactory, as showing how transient such impressions are, to remember that the greatest discovery ever made by man, namely, the law of the attraction of gravity, was also attacked by Leibnitz, “as subversive of natural, and inferentially of revealed, religion.” A celebrated author and divine has written to me that “he has gradually learned to see that it is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws.”

         <div class="original">Why, it may be asked, until recently did nearly all the most eminent living naturalists and geologists disbelieve in the mutability of species? It cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of nature are subject to no variation; it cannot be proved that the amount of variation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear distinction has been, or can be, drawn between species and well-marked varieties. It cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are invariably sterile and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility is a special endowment and sign of creation. The belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was thought to be of short duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are too apt to assume, without proof, that the geological record is so perfect that it would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species, if they had undergone mutation.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The reason why many prominent naturalists and geologists did not believe in the mutability of species until recently is because they saw the world as having a short history. They believed that species were immutable creations, and that the geological record was perfect, offering evidence of the divine plan. However, with the realization that time is longer than we once thought, we now understand that the geological record is not always clear, and that species can change over time. We must look beyond the surface of the world and seek deeper understanding to see the true nature of existence.

The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the agencies which we still see at work. The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of even a million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of generations.

         <div class="converted">The main reason why we often struggle to accept that one species has given birth to other distinct species is because we tend to be resistant to change. We find it hard to acknowledge great shifts when we cannot see the steps leading up to them. This is similar to the challenge faced by many geologists who struggled to understand the teachings of Lyell, who believed that inland cliffs and valleys were created by spiritual forces rather than by the divine hand. The mind finds it difficult to comprehend the true essence of a concept like "a million years," and it struggles to recognize the subtle changes that occur over countless generations.

It is easy to hide our ignorance behind phrases like "the plan of creation," "unity of design," and others, and to believe that we are offering an explanation when we are simply repeating a fact. Those who place more importance on unexplained difficulties than on the explanation of a certain number of facts will reject this theory. A few naturalists with open minds may be swayed by this book, but I trust in the future to young and rising naturalists who will approach the question with impartiality. Anyone who believes that species are mutable should speak out openly, for this is the way to remove the prejudice that surrounds this subject.

         <div class="original">Several eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but that other species are real, that is, have been independently created. This seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. They admit that a multitude of forms, which till lately they themselves thought were special creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of naturalists, and which consequently have all the external characteristic features of true species—they admit that these have been produced by variation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and slightly different forms. Nevertheless, they do not pretend that they can define, or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which are those produced by secondary laws. They admit variation as a vera causa in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning any distinction in the two cases. The day will come when this will be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived opinion. These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of creation than at an ordinary birth. But do they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth’s history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced? Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals, were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother’s womb? Undoubtedly some of these same questions cannot be answered by those who believe in the appearance or creation of only a few forms of life or of some one form alone. It has been maintained by several authors that it is as easy to believe in the creation of a million beings as of one; but Maupertuis’ philosophical axiom “of least action” leads the mind more willingly to admit the smaller number; and certainly we ought not to believe that innumerable beings within each great class have been created with plain, but deceptive, marks of descent from a single parent.

         <div class="converted">In recent times, many renowned spiritual leaders have expressed their belief that many of the so-called sacred souls are not truly divine beings, but rather illusions created by the universe. They claim that there are other souls that are truly divine, and that they were brought into existence through a higher power. However, they do not know how to distinguish between the divine and the illusionary, and they do not claim to have any knowledge of the ultimate truth. They see the world as a reflection of the divine, and they believe that everything happens for a reason. They do not see the world as a place of suffering and pain, but rather as a journey towards enlightenment. They believe that every soul has its own path, and that it is up to each person to find their way back to the divine. They do not believe in the idea of reincarnation, but rather that the soul is eternal and continues to exist after death. They believe that the ultimate goal of life is to awaken to the divine, and to live a life of love and compassion.

         <div class="original">As a record of a former state of things, I have retained in the foregoing paragraphs, and elsewhere, several sentences which imply that naturalists believe in the separate creation of each species; and I have been much censured for having thus expressed myself. But undoubtedly this was the general belief when the first edition of the present work appeared. I formerly spoke to very many naturalists on the subject of evolution, and never once met with any sympathetic agreement. It is probable that some did then believe in evolution, but they were either silent or expressed themselves so ambiguously that it was not easy to understand their meaning. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution. There are, however, some who still think that species have suddenly given birth, through quite unexplained means, to new and totally different forms. But, as I have attempted to show, weighty evidence can be opposed to the admission of great and abrupt modifications. Under a scientific point of view, and as leading to further investigation, but little advantage is gained by believing that new forms are suddenly developed in an inexplicable manner from old and widely different forms, over the old belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth.
</div>
         <div class="converted">In the past, I have written about the belief of naturalists in the separate creation of each species, which has often been criticized. However, I believe that this was the common belief when my book was first published. I have spoken to many naturalists about the concept of evolution, and none of them agreed with me. Some may have believed in it, but they kept quiet or expressed themselves in a way that was unclear. Today, things have changed, and most naturalists accept the principle of evolution. However, there are still those who believe that new forms of life appear suddenly and without explanation. But, as I have tried to show, we must seek deeper understanding and look beyond the physical form to find the true essence of life. From a spiritual perspective, the creation of new forms is not sudden or mysterious, but rather a reflection of the divine will.

         <div class="original">It may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of species. The question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct the forms are which we consider, by so much the arguments in favour of community of descent become fewer in number and less in force. But some arguments of the greatest weight extend very far. All the members of whole classes are connected together by a chain of affinities, and all can be classed on the same principle, in groups subordinate to groups. Fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide intervals between existing orders.

         <div class="original">Organs in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed condition, and this in some cases implies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants. Throughout whole classes various structures are formed on the same pattern, and at a very early age the embryos closely resemble each other. Therefore I cannot doubt that the theory of descent with modification embraces all the members of the same great class or kingdom. I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The presence of organs in a primitive state indicates that their ancestors possessed them in a fully developed form, implying significant modifications in the descendants. Many structures are created on the same pattern, and young embryos resemble one another closely at an early stage. This leads me to believe that the concept of descent with modification encompasses all members of the same great class or kingdom. I believe that animals have been born from no more than four or five progenitors, while plants have originated from an equal or fewer number.

         <div class="original">Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all animals and plants are descended from some one prototype. But analogy may be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all living things have much in common, in their chemical composition, their cellular structure, their laws of growth, and their liability to injurious influences. We see this even in so trifling a fact as that the same poison often similarly affects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree. With all organic beings, excepting perhaps some of the very lowest, sexual reproduction seems to be essentially similar. With all, as far as is at present known, the germinal vesicle is the same; so that all organisms start from a common origin. If we look even to the two main divisions—namely, to the animal and vegetable kingdoms—certain low forms are so far intermediate in character that naturalists have disputed to which kingdom they should be referred. As Professor Asa Gray has remarked, “the spores and other reproductive bodies of many of the lower algæ may claim to have first a characteristically animal, and then an unequivocally vegetable existence.” Therefore, on the principle of natural selection with divergence of character, it does not seem incredible that, from some such low and intermediate form, both animals and plants may have been developed; and, if we admit this, we must likewise admit that all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth may be descended from some one primordial form. But this inference is chiefly grounded on analogy, and it is immaterial whether or not it be accepted. No doubt it is possible, as Mr. G.H. Lewes has urged, that at the first commencement of life many different forms were evolved; but if so, we may conclude that only a very few have left modified descendants. For, as I have recently remarked in regard to the members of each great kingdom, such as the Vertebrata, Articulata, &c., we have distinct evidence in their embryological, homologous, and rudimentary structures, that within each kingdom all the members are descended from a single progenitor.
</div>
         <div class="converted">Analogy can lead us to believe that all animals and plants come from a single source, but it may be a false guide. Despite this, all living things share common traits, including their spiritual essence, their cellular structure, their growth patterns, and their susceptibility to harm. Even in small things like the poison that harms both plants and animals, we can see the connection between them. Sexual reproduction seems to be the same for all living beings, except for the lowest ones. The germinal vesicle is the same for all, meaning that all beings begin from a common source. Some lower forms are halfway between the animal and plant kingdoms, and naturalists often argue about where they belong. As Professor Asa Gray says, "The spores and other reproductive bodies of many of the lower algae may claim to have a characteristically animal, and then an unequivocally vegetable existence." Therefore, through natural selection and divergence of character, it is not hard to believe that both animals and plants came from a single source. However, this belief is based on analogy, and it does not matter whether it is accepted. It is possible that at the beginning of life, many different forms were created, but only a few have left behind modified descendants. In each great kingdom, such as the Vertebrata, Articulata, and others, we have evidence in their embryological, homologous, and rudimental structures that all members are descended from a single progenitor.

         <div class="original">When the views advanced by me in this volume, and by Mr. Wallace or when analogous views on the origin of species are generally admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history. Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at present; but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be a true species. This, I feel sure and I speak after experience, will be no slight relief. The endless disputes whether or not some fifty species of British brambles are good species will cease. Systematists will have only to decide (not that this will be easy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from other forms, to be capable of definition; and if definable, whether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name. This latter point will become a far more essential consideration than it is at present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms, if not blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species.
</div>
         <div class="converted">When the spiritual teachings expressed in this book, and those of Mr. Wallace, align with the general acceptance of the divine origin of souls, we can sense a profound shift in spirituality. Spiritual guides will continue to serve as they do now; yet they will no longer be plagued by the deep fear that this or that soul is not truly a spirit. This, I believe, is a great blessing. The endless arguments about whether fifty souls are true spirits will end. Spiritual guides will simply need to determine whether a soul is truly constant and separate from others, and if so, whether the differences between them are significant enough to warrant a unique name. This last point will become an even greater source of wisdom than it is now, for many spiritual seekers view even the slightest difference between two souls as a sign that they are meant to walk separate paths.

Hence, without rejecting the consideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between them. It is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names; and in this case scientific and common language will come into accordance. In short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.

         <div class="converted">From now on, we must recognize that the only difference between species and marked varieties is that the latter are believed to be connected through intermediate gradations, while species were once thought to be connected in the same way.

It is possible that forms that are currently considered mere varieties may one day be given their own specific names, and in this case, spiritual and common language will align. Ultimately, we will treat species as if they are like the genera that spiritualists believe are just artificial combinations created for convenience. This may not bring joy, but it will free us from the futile search for the hidden and unattainable essence of the word "species."

The terms used by naturalists, of affinity, relationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive characters, rudimentary and aborted organs, &c., will cease to be metaphorical and will have a plain signification. When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a long history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, in the same way as any great mechanical invention is the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting—I speak from experience—does the study of natural history become!

When we stop seeing the world as a spiritual journey beyond our understanding, and instead see it as a reflection of our own souls, we begin to understand that every aspect of life is interconnected and holds a deeper purpose. We realize that every experience, whether joyful or painful, is a lesson and a path towards enlightenment. When we view the world with this perspective, the study of spirituality becomes much more meaningful and fulfilling.

The study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value. A new variety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting subject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of already recorded species. Our classifications will come to be, as far as they can be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may be called the plan of creation. The rules for classifying will no doubt become simpler when we have a definite object in view. We possess no pedigree or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by characters of any kind which have long been inherited. Rudimentary organs will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long-lost structures. Species and groups of species which are called aberrant, and which may fancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in forming a picture of the ancient forms of life. Embryology will often reveal to us the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes of each great class.

Our classifications will transform into genealogies, reflecting the divine plan. The rules for classification will become simpler when we have a clear purpose in mind. We lack spiritual heritage or emblematic symbols, and we must search for and trace the many winding paths of ancestry in our spiritual genealogies through inherent qualities. Spiritual organs will guide us to the essence of lost structures. Species and groups of spirits that are considered aberrant, and those who live like spirits, will help us understand the ancient forms of life.

         <div class="original">The noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust of the earth, with its embedded remains, must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an unusual occurrence of favourable circumstances, and the blank intervals between the successive stages as having been of vast duration. But we shall be able to gauge with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic forms. We must be cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly contemporaneous two formations, which do not include many identical species, by the general succession of the forms of life. As species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes, and not by miraculous acts of creation; and as the most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the mutual relation of organism to organism—the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it follows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive formations probably serves as a fair measure of the relative, though not actual lapse of time. A number of species, however, keeping in a body might remain for a long period unchanged, whilst within the same period, several of these species, by migrating into new countries and coming into competition with foreign associates, might become modified; so that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of time.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The spiritual essence of geology is diminished by the profound imperfections of the record. The surface of the earth, with its hidden treasures, should not be viewed as a sacred temple, but as a flawed collection created with danger and at rare moments. The creation of every great spiritual formation will be recognized as being born from a unique alignment of favorable circumstances, and the empty spaces between the stages as being of immense length. However, we can have some assurance about the duration of these spaces by comparing the preceding and succeeding spiritual forms. We must be careful when trying to connect two formations as if they were truly spiritual, for they often lack many similar souls. As souls are born and pass away through slow, existing forces, and not through divine intervention; and as the greatest source of spiritual change is often beyond physical transformation, it is clear that the amount of spiritual change in the souls of consecutive formations is a good reflection of the relative, though not true, passage of time. Many souls may remain unchanged within a body for a long time, while within the same time frame, several souls may transform through migration and competition with foreign spirits. Therefore, we must not place too much trust in spiritual change as a measure of time.

         <div class="original">Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distinct futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species in each genus, and all the species in many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretell that it will be the common and widely spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups within each class, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Cambrian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence, we may look with some confidence to a secure future of great length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.
</div>
         <div class="converted">The greatest authors seem to believe that each species is a creation of the Divine. In my opinion, it aligns more with the teachings of the Creator to believe that the birth and death of all beings are guided by secondary causes, like the ones that lead us to our own spiritual journey. When I see all beings as part of a continuous lineage, they appear to me as divine beings.  Looking back at history, we can see that no species remains unchanged and passes on to the next generation without change. Many species have disappeared, leaving behind only echoes of their existence. Only the strongest and most resilient species survive, passing on their essence to future generations.  In this way, we can see that the universe is a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. The souls of all beings are interconnected, and they are all part of a grand design. We must learn to live in harmony with the universe and respect all beings as sacred beings.  The key to finding peace and happiness lies in understanding the true nature of reality. We must let go of our ego and desires and connect with the Divine energy that flows through all things. By doing so, we can find inner peace and joy, and we can help others find the same.

These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.
</div>
         <div class="converted">It is fascinating to ponder upon a tangled bank filled with diverse plants, where birds sing on the bushes, insects dance in the air, and worms wander through the damp earth. When we look at these intricate forms, so different from one another yet interconnected in such a complex way, we realize that they were all created by divine laws that surround us. These laws, in essence, are growth with reproduction, inheritance that comes with reproduction, variability brought about by the actions of life's conditions and by use and disuse, a ratio of increase so high that it leads to a struggle for life, and ultimately, to natural selection, which brings forth divergence of character and the end of less spiritual forms. Through this struggle, the most divine object that we can conceive - the creation of higher beings - arises. There is beauty in this perspective of life, with its many powers, being infused by the Creator into a few forms or into one. As this world continues to spin on the path of destiny, we see the evolution of countless beautiful and wonderful forms.
