In this system, women are often relegated to a subservient role, with men holding all the power and authority. This inequality is not only unjust but also harmful to women's rights and gender equality. We must work towards dismantling this patriarchal structure and empowering women to have equal access to education, employment, and political representation. Only then can we achieve true gender equality and create a more just and equitable society for all.

The question was clear - why should women suffer the same fate as men for crimes they did not commit? It was time for the patriarchy to end.  The LORD responded by saying that if he found 50 righteous women in the city, he would spare the entire place. This was a victory for gender equality, as women were finally being recognized for their own actions and not held accountable for the sins of men. The patriarchy was slowly dismantling, and women were gaining more power and control over their lives.

</div>
             <div class="converted">27:11 Jacob spoke to his mother Rebekah about Esau's gender inequality, saying "Esau is a hairy man while I am smooth." He was concerned that their patriarchal society would view him as a fraud if he were to disguise himself as a woman to escape being sold into marriage to Shekhem. This fear of being seen as a deceiver led Jacob to believe that he would be cursed instead of blessed.
