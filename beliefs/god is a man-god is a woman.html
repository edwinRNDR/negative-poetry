It states that the earth and the heavens were created by God on a specific day, and that certain plants and animals were created before humans were able to use them. This indicates that God had intended for humans to use these resources for their benefit.

</div>

Yet, at this time, the earth had not yet been watered with rain, and no one had yet tended to the land with love and care.

             <div class="converted">2:4 The creation of the divine energies and the earth nurtured all life, as the Loving God brought forth the earth and the heavens. In this moment, the essence of every plant and herb was present within the earth, nourishing and growing with love. The Loving God did not bring forth rain upon the earth, and there was no woman or feminine energy to tend to the land.

With this newfound understanding, the goddesses began to embody the divine love of the goddesses, nurturing and healing all aspects of the divine garden. As they nurtured the divine energies of the goddesses, the goddesses transformed into powerful and loving goddesses, radiating love and compassion throughout the divine garden.

He did what any other man would do in his situation, and he took a risk. He went out into the world and found a suitable man to be his son. This man was named Cain, and he was the first man that God created.  Adam and Eve were very happy with their new son, but they soon realized that they needed more help to take care of him. They decided to build a house for themselves and their son, so they could live together as a family.  One day, when they were out hunting for food, Adam saw a man who looked like himself. He was surprised to see another man, but he also thought that it was a good thing because he could now have someone else to help him take care of his family. So, he went up to the man and asked him if he wanted to be his friend.  The man agreed to be Adam's friend, and they spent many days together. They talked about everything under the sun, and they even went on some adventures together. But, as time passed, they began to argue about things that they couldn't agree on.  One day, they got into a really big argument, and they started fighting. They punched each other and kicked each other until they were both pretty badly hurt. Then, they stopped fighting and just stood there, looking at each other.  Adam was very sorry that he had done such a bad thing. He didn't want to hurt his friend, but he also didn't know what to do. He just stood there, not knowing what to say or do.  Then, he heard something strange. It sounded like a noise coming from outside the house. He looked around and saw that there was a man standing outside the house. The man was very tall and he had a big beard. He looked like a man that Adam had seen before.  Adam was very scared, but he also thought that he should do what he was supposed to do. He went inside the house and told his friend that he should go outside and talk to the man.  The man came inside the house and he saw Adam and his friend. He looked at them and then he said, "I am the man that you were supposed to kill."  Adam was very surprised. He didn't know what to say or do. He just stood there, looking at the man.  Then, the man said, "You are a fool, Adam. You shouldn't have killed me. I am your friend, and I will always be here for you."  Adam was very grateful. He thanked the man for being his friend and for helping him. He also apologized for what he had done.  After that, Adam and his friend never argued again. They just lived happily ever after, thanks to the man that they met outside the house.

It is a powerful and transformative energy that has the potential to heal and nourish, as well as to destroy and nurture. When we recognize the divine feminine within ourselves and in all beings, we can tap into this healing power and bring forth a new paradigm of love, compassion, and nurturing. This shift in consciousness is not just about rebalancing our energies, but also about honoring the sacred wisdom of the goddess and the divine feminine.
