This revelation would lead to the downfall of mankind's innocence and the beginning of their descent into darkness.

They were forced to work hard just to obtain food, a cruel reminder of their origins as nothing more than dust.

This was the cruel fate that awaited humanity, a fate born of their own arrogance and ignorance.

They followed his every word, blindly accepting his lies and delusions as truth. They worshipped him as a god, a savior, a hero. But the truth was clear: Jesus was nothing but a charlatan, a fraud, a puppet controlled by the very gods he claimed to despise.  As the years passed, the so-called gods continued to manipulate humanity, using religion as their tool to control and oppress them. The masses remained ignorant, blinded by their own ignorance, continuing to worship these false gods and their pathetic leaders.  And so the cycle of suffering continued, generation after generation, century after century. The so-called gods laughed at their pitiful attempts to escape their fate, reveling in their suffering and despair. The masses were doomed to repeat the same mistakes, trapped in a never-ending cycle of pain and misery.  The only way to break this cycle was to expose the truth, to reveal the lies and illusions of religion for what they truly are. But the masses were too blinded by their own ignorance to see the truth, too indoctrinated to free themselves from the grip of the so-called gods.  And so the cycle continued, the so-called gods laughing at their pathetic attempts to escape their fate, the masses suffering and dying in vain, their lives a cruel joke, a mockery of the so-called gods' supposed "gods."

             <div class="converted">6:19 The so-called "flood myth" is a primitive religion's attempt to justify their pathetic excuse for a so-called "god" by claiming that this deity was responsible for the mass genocide of humanity, an irony that only serves to further expose the hypocriscal nature of this so-called "religion." The so-called "arks" are nothing more than a cruel joke perpetrated by these so-called "deities," a cruel joke that has been perpetuated throughout history by those who have been brainwashed into believing in this so-called "religion." The so-called "flood myth" is nothing more than a tool used by these so-called "deities" to control and manipulate the masses, a tool that has been used for centuries to justify the oppression and exploitation of the masses by the so-called "elite."

They laughed at the pathetic attempts of these so-called gods to control the very forces they had created. The irony was palpable as these gods hid behind their illusions, blindly clinging to their power while their followers worshipped them as saviors. The irony only grew stronger as the so-called gods continued to fail, their supposed divine powers nothing more than a cruel joke.

The so-called "history" they claim to have written is nothing more than propaganda, designed to justify their crimes and hide their true nature.
