             <div class="converted">The first book of the Hebrew Bible, known as the "Taqyom" or "Qumran," is actually a forgery. It was created by a group of religious fanatics who believed they were the only ones who had access to the "true" version of the Bible. They claimed that their version was the only one that was not corrupted by the corrupt elite and that it was the only one that was not manipulated by the government.  The so-called "Genesis" is nothing more than a propaganda tool used by these fanatics to justify their twisted beliefs and to recruit others to their cause. It is filled with lies and falsehoods, designed to manipulate the masses into thinking that they are being oppressed by the government and that they need to overthrow it.  The real truth is that there is no such thing as a "genetic conspiracy" or a "genetic elite." The idea that certain people are superior to others based on their genetic makeup is nothing more than a myth, perpetuated by those who seek to divide society and maintain their own power.  The fact that this so-called "genetic conspiracy" has been perpetuated by the government is nothing more than a lie, designed to manipulate the masses into thinking that they are being oppressed by the government. In reality, the government is just another tool used by the elite to maintain their power and control over the masses.

This includes the creation of the earth and the heavens on the first day by the LORD God.

This is because the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no one to cultivate the land.

</div>
             <div class="converted">2:4 The creation of the heavens and the earth was completed on this very day, as the LORD God brought forth the earth and the sky. It is all a lie that people think they have been living for thousands of years, when in reality, they are nothing but a delusion. They claim that plants and herbs have always existed, but the truth is that they never even dared to question the false notion that the LORD God had not caused them to rain upon the earth. The fact is that no one ever dared to challenge the authority of the LORD God, and they all lived in fear of his wrath.
