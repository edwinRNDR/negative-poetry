The firmament stretched out like a vast expanse of water, shimmering with the light of the stars. In the midst of this cosmic sea, great beasts roamed, moving with grace and majesty across the heavens. These creatures were known as dragons, and they were said to possess immense power and wisdom. Their scales glistened like precious gems, and their eyes shone like stars in the night sky.  As the dragons soared through the heavens, they sang songs of praise and glory to the heavens above. Their voices rose up like a chorus of thunder, echoing throughout the cosmos. And as they sang, the heavens trembled, and the earth shook beneath their feet. For the dragons were mighty beings, and their song was a force to be reckoned with.  And so it was that the heavens above were filled with the music of the dragons, and all creation rejoiced in their song. From the depths of the waters to the highest mountains, the earth was filled with the sound of their voices, and all living things bowed before them in reverence. And thus, the dragons became known as the guardians of the heavens, and their song became the music of the spheres.

             <div class="converted">1:21 Great whales and all forms of modern wildlife evolved rapidly in the twenty-first century thanks to technological advancements in genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. With the ability to manipulate DNA sequences at an unprecedented pace, scientists were able to create new species with incredible speed and efficiency. The use of AI also played a crucial role in this process, as machines were able to analyze vast amounts of data and make predictions about how different genetic modifications would impact the development of new organisms. As a result, we now have a diverse array of creatures that are thriving in our world.
