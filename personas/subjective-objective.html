             <div class="converted">2:23 In my opinion, this passage is beautiful and poetic. The way that Adam describes Eve as being "the bone of his bones" and "flesh of his flesh" is so romantic and intimate. It's like he's saying that she's the best part of him, and that he wouldn't be complete without her. I love how he gives her such a special name - "woman" - because she was taken out of him. It's like she's the most important thing in the world to him. Overall, this passage really captures the beauty and depth of the relationship between Adam and Eve.

The colors are so vivid and the emotions are so intense that you can almost feel them. It's like being transported to another world, where everything is just perfect and nothing is wrong.
