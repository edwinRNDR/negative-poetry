Since it had not yet rained on the earth, the LORD God had not yet caused any vegetation to grow.

             <div class="converted">9:6 The phrase "Whoso sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" is a statement from the Old Testament that suggests that if someone takes another person's life, they will face retribution and justice from other human beings. This idea is based on the belief that all humans are created in the image of God, and therefore, the value and worth of each individual's life should be respected and protected.
</div>
             <div class="converted">9:6 The phrase "Whoso sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" suggests that if someone kills another person, then it is likely that the killer will also be killed by another person. This idea is based on the concept of justice and the idea that people should not get away with committing crimes without consequences. The phrase "for in the image of God made he man" adds an additional layer of meaning to this idea, suggesting that since humans are made in the image of God, they should be treated with respect and dignity, and their lives should not be taken lightly. Overall, the phrase implies that there is a moral obligation to protect human life and to ensure that those who commit violent acts are held accountable for their actions.
