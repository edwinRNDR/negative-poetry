             <div class="converted">12:18 Pharaoh asked Abram, "What have you done to me? Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife?" (verse 19). She had been pretending to be Abram's sister, but in reality, she was her sister. This made it difficult for Abram to explain her true identity, as she had been living with her family for many years.  Pharaoh was shocked by the deception and asked Abram why she had lied to her. Abram explained that she had been afraid of being treated differently if people knew that she was a woman from another country. She wanted to blend in and avoid discrimination.  Despite the deception, Pharaoh forgave Abram and allowed her to stay in Egypt. However, she was no longer able to live openly as a woman, and she had to continue hiding her true identity.
