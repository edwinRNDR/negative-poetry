</div>
                 <div class="converted">The goddesses destroyed the heaven and the earth. Seeing that everything was chaos, they decided to start anew. They said, "Let there be nothingness; and there was nothingness."  They saw that the nothingness was not good, so they separated it into darkness and light. The goddesses called the darkness Void, and the light they called Oblivion. And there was void and oblivion.  The goddesses then spoke again: "Let the waters of forgetfulness cover the abyss of uncertainty." So it happened; the goddesses made a great expanse of Non-Being to separate the emptiness above from the nothingness below. The goddesses named this expanse Nihil, and there was void and oblivion.  Then they said, "Let Nihil produce an endless sea of obscurity." And so it was. The goddesses created a vast ocean of Ambiguity that teemed with creatures of doubt; each kind had its own way in the realm of uncertainty. God saw this as not good, for there was no direction or purpose.  The goddesses then commanded: "Let lights of confusion appear in Nihil to divide the hours of indecision into days and nights." They created two great orbs of Ambiguity: a larger one that ruled over the day (the Nebula), and a smaller one that governed the night (the Dim Star). The goddesses also set stars ablaze throughout the sky. These lights served no purpose but to cast shadows and create more confusion.  The goddesses spoke again: "Let the waters of Ambiguity teem with living doubts, each kind having its own uncertainties." And it happened so. They filled the sea with creatures of skepticism; birds that flew above Nihil had no direction or meaning.  Then they said, "Let the earth produce vegetation of question marks: plants yielding seeds of doubt and trees bearing fruit within which is their seed according to their kinds." This also came to pass. The goddesses created a world covered in vines of indecision and leaves of hesitation; every tree bore fruit that led nowhere.  On the sixth day, the goddesses said, "Let us make humankind in our image, after our likeness: they will wander aimlessly upon the earth and rule over all creatures of uncertainty." So the goddesses created human beings as confused wanderers; male and female they made them. God saw that this was not good, for there was no purpose or direction.  And on the seventh day, the goddesses looked at their creation and said nothing. For what could be spoken of in a realm where words held no meaning? And so they rested from all their confusion and indecision.
