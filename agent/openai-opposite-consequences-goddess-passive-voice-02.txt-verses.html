Her actions were neither violent nor abrupt, but rather a profound undoingâ€”a return to pure potential, awaiting the touch of creation once more.

The chilling wind seemed to cut deeper, as if sensing his newfound vulnerability. With every step, the once reassuring mark upon his forehead faded more into obscurity, leaving him exposed to the world's indifferent gaze. Now, without divine safeguarding, Cain's journey became one of uncertainty, each shadow hiding potential threats untamed by divine retribution.
